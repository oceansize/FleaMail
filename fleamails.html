  <p>dear friends,</p>
  <p>
    there was a time in years gone by that i would write these things called
    ‘flea mails’ where i would pontificate, spew, spiel, write a bunch of
    nonsense and on rare occasion say something of value. i have decided to
    resume this practice, and this it, i’m doing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    i don’t like to use capital letters because i am too lazy to press the extra
    buttons on my computer, if that is disheartening, feel free to be
    disappointed in me. i have poor grammar and a pretty shoddy mind in general,
    but my aim is true and my motives are pure.
  </p>
  <p>
    i just listened to the new nick cave and the bad seeds record ‘skeleton
    tree’. It is just so powerful, beautiful, flexible like the ocean of
    beautiful melancholy from which is birthed, and impenetrable as the hardest
    substance on earth, so fucking hard, i am absolutely blown away. skeleton
    tree. none of the obvious moves that the rest of us resort to, just the most
    sacred essence of what is beautiful about the human condition, making sense
    of it all. so much love. my heart is full. listening to it was like taking a
    warm bath when i was frozen and naked in a snow blizzard. man, what a
    record. thanks to nick cave and the bad seeds for letting us all in on it.
  </p>
  <p>
    some of you might have seen that some weeks back, i befriended a lowland
    mountain gorilla named koko.
    <a target="_blank" href="www.koko.org">Koko</a> speaks sign language very
    well, and understands spoken english very well also. If i was capable of
    articulating the profundity of the feeling i had when we stared meaningfully
    into each others eyes, the love and compassion i felt there, the
    understanding from one creature to another, i would be a very great writer
    indeed. I had known about koko for many years, and had always fantasized
    about playing bass for her to see if she would connect with a rhythm,
    experience the kind of trance that i do when i lose myself in a dope groove.
    she rarely meets new people and when she does, doesn’t always let them come
    into the enclosure where she lives. I stood outside her enclosure and played
    bass for her, then she enthusiastically signed to me “koko loves!” “come
    visit, hurry!” my heart was touched and i went in there with her and we took
    turns playing the bass and hung out playing games and chatting for a couple
    of hours, it was just the most beautiful thing. i love koko with all my
    heart, she was kind and intelligent, and understood so much about my world,
    i felt like such an ignoramus and a fool for how little i was able to
    decipher about hers, all the gorilla intelligence that she has, that I was
    unable to see. As a human, it is mind boggling to us that an animal can do
    things that we relate to, human things. But for us to be able to speak in
    gorilla? to achieve some of the telepathic communication, and understanding
    of things that we are completely unable comprehend? now that would be an
    accomplishment.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am in stockholm right now, we are playing here tomorrow night. been on
    tour for about three months now, we started bout a month before we put our
    last record 'the getaway’. It has warmed my heart to be met with so much
    excitement, for us all to get together and make these gigs happen, it is a
    spiritual experience for me each night. I yearn to be a vehicle of infinite
    love for all of you, to let it all come through, to vibrate like a fucking
    crazed animal. i love you, the tour continues, the rocking goes on, i am a
    humble student.

    I have had a powerful paternal instinct since I was a kid. I wanted to be a
    dad when I had no business being one. Luckily my teenage girlfriend was much
    more sensible than me in that regard. In fact, it could easily be sensibly
    argued that I was completely unprepared and too immature to be a dad when I
    had my first child at the age of 25 (going on 15 emotionally). But man, I
    always loved the idea of having kids; they seemed like so much fun, partly,
    it occurs to me, just because I could get away with it, to create my own
    world independent of the cruelness that seemed so prevalent out there.
  </p>
  <p>
    When one hears about someone else having a baby, it is such a happy thing,
    and congratulations and well wishes around. But, having your own baby is the
    most magical, shockingly unbelievable miracle that ever occurred in the
    universe.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Clara was born in 1988, it was the most glorious moment of my life. I
    rose above the birthing scene and looked down at her beautiful and totally
    spent mama radiating love, and me, weeping, scissors in hand cutting the
    umbilical cord. Driving home with that little swaddling babe was the
    greatest drive of my life. Never before did I feel such a profound sense of
    purpose. Everything I did in my life from then on became a richer
    experience. Every note that I played, every basketball I that bounced, every
    book that I read, every prayer that I offered, I did to nurture myself
    inside and out, so that I might be a better parent for her. I quit doing
    drugs and began the painful journey of working through my own fears so that
    I might be a kinder, stronger, more conscious person. Clara gave me
    everything.
  </p>
  <p>
    Being a father offers the greatest opportunity to love…the chance to learn
    what it is to be selfless, and to reap the greatest rewards from your work.
    The greatest parenting advice that I ever got was from the great Maya
    Angelou, who said “your only responsibility as a parent is to see the sun
    rise and set every time your child walks into the room.”
  </p>
  <p>
    As men, we define ourselves by the quality of our parenting. In no other way
    are our weaknesses and strengths more apparent. I have been a great, loving,
    nurturing, inspiring dad, and I have failed miserably as a dad many times
    and been a short-tempered, selfish jerk. But no matter what, nothing is more
    important to me, and I will continue strive to get better at it.
  </p>
  <p>
    My relationship with my own father has been interesting. He left when I was
    six years old and went to live in another country. My mother married a new
    man –a complicated guy — who had a serious substance-abuse problem and was
    not very available to be a parent. As a result there was never really a dad
    around, and I ran wild in the street getting into all kinds of craziness. I
    am grateful for everything exactly as it is and wouldn’t trade it for any
    other life, but I definitely did not experience any kind of a close
    son/father relationship.
  </p>
  <p>
    This situation worked for me and against me with my own fathering skills. In
    one way I have had no role model to study, but in a deeply positive way, I
    have been even more determined to give my kids everything that I never had,
    to love them and to provide them with every opportunity to allow their
    spirits to soar.
  </p>
  <p>
    My emptiness taught me what I believe to be the cure for that sense of
    desperation and of longing–I am full of love for both of my fathers. Over
    time, I developed a loving relationship with my real dad. We got to know
    each other when I was in my 30s. My stepfather, who passed away, gave me the
    gift of music, and loved me the best that he knew how, given his own
    circumstances. Though my childhood was without parental guidance, it gave me
    an opportunity to go my own way.
  </p>
  <p>
    When my oldest daughter was 17 years old — and preparing to go to college —
    I had another little girl named Sunny. It has been the most amazing
    experience to raise up one little whippersnapper, have her grow up and leave
    the nest (not really), and then segue right into another little girl. I
    learned a lot the first time around, and I think I am a little better at
    being a present papa. But, it’s not about me, it’s about her. Every morning
    when I get up bleary-eyed and stumble into the kitchen to make her
    breakfast, and tell her “for crying out loud stop fooling around and go
    brush your teeth!” and we do our morning dance and drive to school listening
    to the terrible pop music that she likes, I know in the depths of my being,
    that nothing ever could make me happier. I am in awe of my kids, and to all
    the other papas out there I say, “Hooray.”

    Hello men and women and boys and girls and all manner of animal and fish.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are having this break right now and it is really good for us,
    Ahhhhhhhhhhh....reeeeeeelaaxxxxx. We just toured for about 5 months, and a
    little battery recharging is in order. Befre the tour started we spent a
    solid year, working in a new Josh Klinghoffer, writing, recording, doing
    press, all non stop, it is great to stop for a minute. Being in the ocean is
    the greatest thing, the waves flowing in and out , up and down, getting in
    touch with the world breathing like that fills me with the power. I love to
    sweat blood and truth at every show, or not play at all, as anyone has seen
    us knows (i hope), and having this down time, man, i am getting raring to go
    for when we start the u.s. legs of this tour in a couple of weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are gonna be home in a couple of days and I am excited about that. I am
    thinking about my studio, all the instruments in it, the recording
    equipment, and it seems ike paradise to me. I just wanna play and write,
    absorb my days completely into music. Actually, I have had a hard time
    letting go and just being on vacation, I have such a burning desire to get
    in that studio, but some surfing is straightening me out, forcing me to calm
    down. As Marisa Pouw used to say to me in a matronly voice, "settle down
    little fighter".
  </p>
  <p>
    For all the people who follow me on twitter, I'm sorry about all the
    basketball tweets I just cant help it, basketball is very emotional for me,
    Just like music. Maybe I should just start a basketball blog and keep it
    separate from everything else.

    We are getting inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.I am not usually
    one to get to excited about awards or accolades, but about this one I am
    very excited indeed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our band is really riding a high right now. We are out on the road, playing
    some of best shows we have ever done. We are establishing a new language
    with Josh and there is a feeling of hope and potential in what we are doing
    that is really inspiring to us. Each time we step out on the stage it feels
    so creative and vibrant, we are really having a blast playing the shows and
    it fills my days with meaning. I feel an infinite energy from what we are
    doing and looking forward to taking this togetherness we are forging out on
    tour, and getting in the studio and making new music. Feels like we are
    growing like a new born baby, and that is best feeling that I can have ever
    have in our band.
  </p>
  <p>
    So hearing this news about the hall of fame now really seems like it has
    extra significance for me. To be recognized this way seems especially full
    and profound. It makes me think about Hillel Slovak, without whom we would
    have never existed, and who created with us the foundation of our sound. He
    directly influences everything we have ever done. What he did with us in our
    early years is the blueprint of what we are. This would have meant a lot to
    him, and I love him so much. And of course, the mighty Jack Irons, our other
    founding member, who fortunately, is here to enjoy this moment with us.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also makes me think of something I think of everyday anyways. Of John
    Frusciante, the virtuoso musician and songwriter who gave so much to our
    band. Without him, we would not be going to the hall of fame. He wrote
    countless great things with us, played an infinite amount of stunning
    things, and taught us how to be a great band. He helped lift us to a much
    higher level, he is the greatest. We connected deeply for many years, and he
    left our band with many gifts.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am truly grateful for this honor. To our fans, who have supported us for
    all these years, given us purpose, and wildly energized us night after
    night, thank you.

<p>HI.</p>
  <p>
    Sitting here in my hotel room in Munich. It is a really funny hotel room,
    weird orange, yellow and brown colors in the rug and walls. A spiral
    staircase that goes up to the bedroom. Kind of a funny surrealish spinal tap
    moment me sitting here listening to bad music coming out of the television,
    too lazy to get my boom box out of its case and put on something decent.
    wait hold on, i gotta turn this garbage off its doing something bad to my
    soul.
  </p>
  <p>aaaahhhh this silence is so much better.</p>
  <p>
    So we were home for a week and then headed back to Europe for another couple
    of weeks before the christmas break. While we were home, the day before we
    left, we made a video for our song 'Look Around'. It was such a fun
    experience, truly liberating and wild feeling for me, I have high hopes for
    the thing, haven't seen the footage yet though.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am just in the final pages of the book 'Anna Karenina' by Leo Tolstoy, it
    has been a long read that was a little arduous at times, adjusting my brain
    to the long passages written about a time that is hard to wrap my head
    around. But, I never gave up! And the final few chapters are truly riveting,
    tragic and sad and beautiful. As Joe Strummer said, "It's a sad and
    beautiful world". I'm not sure what I will read next, probably Jerry West's
    biography.'
  </p>
  <p>
    Speaking of books, I heard that there is a movie just made of 'Midnight's
    Children', the book by Salman Rushdie. That is very exciting to me, I love
    the writing of Salman Rushdie. Also, someone just gave me a copy of a movie
    made of the book 'The Master and Margarita' by the transcendantly good
    writer Mikail Bulgakov. Can't wait to se it!!!!!!! It is 11 hours long i
    think! 11 hours of greatness I am psyched! It could be a terribly made film
    and I will still love it, the book is that amazing. But, I hear it is a well
    made movie.
  </p>
  <p>
    God, I love sports. It seems for many people, sports and art are mutually
    exclusive things, which is hard for me to understand. I love seeing people
    reach for things, really yearn to take themselves to a higher level. It
    really seems the same to me, athletics, arts, academics.....I just dont
    really differentiate between the things, it all feels like human exression
    to me and totally the same. But, my point is that I am a televised sports
    fanatic. It is the only thing I watch on t.v. Basketball season is about to
    start, and as many of you probanly know already, I am an over the top
    unabashed freaky Laker fan. With great anticipation I await to dig in to the
    sumtuous feast that is the NBA season. When it clicks, and a team really
    plays together, it is a beautiful thing to behold.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've never been bored a moment in my life. I've been delirious, I've been
    miserable, but I have never been bored, there's just too much stuff going
    on. I've also been ecstatically happy!
  </p>
  <p>
    The other night when we arrived in Berlin, I took a walk and stumbled upon
    the holocaust memorial there. Man it was a heavy experience. It is made of
    thousands of concrete slabs, I think it is one for every Jew from Berline
    that was killed (not positive about that, it's what I was told). When you
    look at it from the street, it seems as though each concrete slab, which are
    rectangle or square shaped, are about 2 or 3 feet tall. But as you walk into
    it, the ground sinks down and you are surrounded by these monoliths that are
    like ten fet tall. Each one representing a tragic death. It really had a
    powerful effect on me. God bless those poor souls. Sending my love to them.
    It was late at night and I walked into the depth of the thing and really got
    lost in it. It is hard to comprehend that kind of cruelty, genocide. Man. It
    unbelievable what human beings are capable of. I read a while ago about the
    genocide that took place in Rawanda of the Tutsi people. It happened in the
    early nineties. A really great book called "We Wish to Inform You That
    Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families' by Phillip Gourevitch. That is
    a heavy book, but also really uplifting and inspiring. To hear of people who
    suffered the worst tortures that you can imagine, and yet retain their
    humanity, their love, it is amazing how great people can be in the face of
    the most malicious kind of evil. I highly reccomend that book. While I'm
    still on the subject of books, here's another one I reccomend, I was
    thinking about it today during our travel to Munich, about how much it
    inspired me and changed my life. My sister turned me on to it, it is about
    Haiti and an super cool guy who goes there to help out named Paul Farmer,
    and it is called 'Mountains Beyond Mountains' written by Tracy Kidder. It
    blew me away, and because of it I ended up in Haiti a few years after I read
    it. I really loved my trip to Haiti. Actually my trip was with some great
    guys who have an organization called 4real and you can look it up and see a
    film of the trip if you are interested.
  </p>
  <p>Well it's 2:54 am and I'm gonna get into something else now.</p>
  <p>
    Really, this tour is going so well, I'm so happy with the way we are
    playing, and more than that, overwhelmed with gratitude for all of you who
    come to our shows and rock out and really listen. You give me faith.

    This run through Ireland, NOrthern Ireland, and Engladn so far has been
    fulfilling. Playing the music is always such an emotional thing. There are a
    lot of different levels of it for me. In one way, I go into a total
    animalistic single focus on rocking for all I'm worth, giving everything I
    have to make each song it's deepest most intense groove, to give every ounce
    of strength and concentration I can channel to every dynamic and emotiona
    twist and turn of the flow of the music. In another way, I just want to
    connect with the audience, to feel y'all, to do everything i can to uplift
    you, to share the magic from the divine source from where this music comes
    from, to get myself out of the way and let that happen. An in another way,
    the show, the music, all of it is a sanctuary for me, a safe place away from
    the chaos and pain and suffering of the world. Man, the whole thing is such
    a cathartic experience. Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yeah these shows have been fun. While we were here in London, the launch
    happened for the basses created by the great artist Damien Hirst and myself.
    Damien painted each one individually, they are all different and man they
    are just beautiful and wild!. You can see them at the 'Other Criteria' shop
    on New Bond Street in London. You can also see pictures of them at
    Othercriteria.com. They are really amazing pieces of art, and every one of
    them is signed by Damien and I. Some of them come with additional artwork by
    Damien, and collaborative artwork by Damien and I. They are Dope! Rope a
    Dope!!! All of the profit from the sale of these things will go to the
    Silverlake Conservatory of Music, I will not take a penny, and Damien is not
    even taking back the expenses he incurred making them, he has donated all
    his time and energy for free. He is a man among men with a heart the size of
    Leeds. The deluxe editions of the basses also come with individually
    handpainted cases, and are chockfull of great art surprises. Just sayin.
  </p>
  <p>
    We had a party for the basses on the night of the launch and Josh and Chad
    and Mauro and I jammed at it and let our freak flags fly as high as we
    could. Then Ronnie Wood joined us for a jam, and it was a goooooooood one.
    That ol' Ronnie Wood is a superb musician, it is always a beautiful thing to
    play with him.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I find myself this morning at still at the hotel in London, bout to get
    it together to go get on a whirlybird and head for the gig in Glasgow
    tonight. Letyour freak flag fly. Peace and Love to all.

    Last night was such a fun show in Dublin. Truly, Ireland has been an amazing
    place for us to pay through the years. There is something about the soul of
    the place that really touches me. An intangible thing, can't describe it,
    but it blows me away. I think the greatest crowd I ever witnessed was when
    we played Belfast in '91. It was the most explosive feeling I ever got from
    an audience they were just on fire. Anthony begs to differ with me, he say
    the audience we had in Buenos Aires a couple of months ago was just as
    intense, but I don't know. I guess it really is a matter of how you pecieve
    it at the time, sometimes the most still audience can be listening the
    deepest and it is a whole other kind of intensity. But man, sometimes you
    can walk out on stage and they really blast your face off! I hope no other
    countries feel like I am diminishing their connection with us, there are
    certain times and spaces when a magic thing happens that is impossible to
    control. That time in Belfast there was just a feeling in the air. It was a
    time of a ot of trouble there, tanks rolling down the empty streets and guys
    walking around in groups of four holding maching guns scared to death. There
    was a lot of tension in the air. Also, the Rollins bnd opened up the show
    and really stirred up some emotions, it was just a wild night.
  </p>
  <p>
    I purchased a tim whiste the other day in Dublin. I like to sit in my room
    and play it and try to eek out some melancholy tunes. Gets me in touch with
    my Itrish heritage. On my father's side, his grandfather came to Australia
    from Ireland and his grandmother came from Hungary. My mothers side is all
    from England as far as I know. I was born in Australia, left there when I
    was 4, movied to the suburbs of New York when I was 11, then came to L.A.
    when I was 11. I just consider myself from L.A. I really love Los Angeles,
    people have such a weird impression of it around the world. It is really a
    soulful place. People just think about the film industry and the shalowness
    and power hungry weirdos and psycophants that are invoved in it. There is
    also an impression of Beverly HIlls and the weird shallowness of thoughtless
    wealth that is there. The truth is all that shit is but a fraction of what
    L.A. is. It is such a multicultural place, so many ethnicities, and
    cultures, and art and music and cool little working class communities. Such
    a great proximity to the mountains, the ocean, and the desert. Anyways, I'm
    not patriotic at all. I love the United States, I live there and there is so
    much beauty and freedom, but I dont care about it any more than I do about
    Botswana or Timbuktu if you know what I'm saying. I just love the divine
    energy that flows through all of us and everything, and as far as I can
    tell, the ratio of cool thoughtful people to selfish assholes is pretty
    similar everywhere I go, it crosses all ethnic, cultural, and economic
    boundaries.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am addicted to the episodic television program 'Friday NIght LIghts'. It
    really isnt that great, but there are parts of it that are great and I just
    cant stop watching it. I'll be hapy when I am done with it. Well., I;m gonna
    go hit the steets of Dublin a little bit and see what I can find.

    Well, here's my first blog for our new website. I have decided to use
    punctuation and capitals. No more internet jargon or lame abbreviations. No
    more psuedo poetic garbage from me! It took a while to get this website up,
    but here you have it. The inspiration for the look of the website came from
    the great artist Josef Albers work with color science. I know that none of
    it looks anything like Albers, but he was an inspiration nonetheless.

    We have begun our world tour in earnest, and it has been amazing for us. The
    crowds have been phenomenal and I feel our new version of the Red Hot's
    getting better all the time, I believe that we are locking into something
    that can unleash the power of the GODZZZ. We have had some transcendant
    shows, and it feels like we are getting better everyday. I really love my
    bandmates alot, and feel so grateful to be doing what we are doing. The
    feeling of hope and potential for the future of our band is a vibrant and
    colorful one indeed. I just wanna rock with the boys day in and day out, I
    haven't felt so inspired about the Red Hot Chili Peppers in quite some time,
    it feels like a new beginning and our energy is focused like a mofo.

  <p>
    I am deciding whether or not I should curse or not in the course of this
    blogging. My day to day language is full of foul mouthed base
    communications, but in the interest of promoting a higher level of speech I
    will refrain from profanity. Wait......let me try it....fuck fuck shit shit
    fuck fuck fuck shit, ahhh no that didnt sound good, no more profanity and
    that's it. We have a short break from tour right now, I am on a little
  </p>
  <p>
    holiday and staring out to a beautiful river in the lovely town or Cork,
    Ireland right now. This town is beautiful, I truly love Ireland.
  </p>
  <p>That's it for now.</p>
  <p>Sending love to one and all (even mean people),</p>

  <p>of love</p>
  <p>where you can be dashed like yesterday's ragdoll onto an unmmoveable</p>
  <p>razorsharp family of rocks</p>
  <p>or fall like a ray of sun of a friendly cliff into a genius swimming</p>
  <p>hole in a cascading hippie river</p>
  <p>and eat fresh baked bread</p>
  <p>and carry your baby girl in a backpack woodsy hike</p>

  <p>god bless andrew hill</p>
  <p>he is a great musician and composer</p>
  <p>and gave the world so much</p>
  <p>he has shed this mortal experience and gone on to something beautiful</p>
  <p>and us here still still get to listen to his great records and feel</p>
  <p>the magic</p>
  <p>we are finishing up our australian new zealand tour here</p>
  <p>it has been fun and fun</p>
  <p>i have been digging jamming deep in the pocket with my buddies and</p>
  <p>getting way into the groove</p>
  <p>there have been some great feelings of togetherness with the people</p>
  <p>and i got to play my trumpet alot</p>
  <p>and be with my completely rocking wife and genius baby the whole time</p>
  <p>and josh played with us and did great and was a happy thing all the</p>
  <p>way around</p>
  <p>and we got to play with har mar superstar</p>
  <p>who managed along with his band of tony on bass and fab on drums to</p>
  <p>completely rock the party every night</p>
  <p>with gusto</p>
  <p>while still being humble and fun despite that there were nights when</p>
  <p>closed minded individuals didnt want to party with them</p>
  <p>because some people need the radio and television to tell them that</p>
  <p>it is ok first before they party</p>
  <p>but nonetheless the party was being rocked</p>
  <p>and they were a total pleasure to tour with</p>
  <p>we play our last show of it tonight in auckland</p>
  <p>i really wanna come back here when i am not busy playing concerts</p>
  <p>and get around this place and get inside the nature</p>
  <p>and stroll the roll of greenery that i have seen pictures of</p>
  <p>love and good will to all</p>
  <p>and that doesnt leave out anyone</p>
  <p>especially all the great drag queens in hollywood</p>

  <p>yesterday i received very disturbing news that someone has been</p>
  <p>impersonating me on a myspace website</p>
  <p>i do not want to give the name of this idiot's website and grant him</p>
  <p>an iota of dignity that he/she does not deserve</p>
  <p>but i understand that this person has been sending out notes that are</p>
  <p>racist and insulting and disgusting</p>
  <p>i fell terrible that someone would send out racist messages period</p>
  <p>and even worse that it is done in my name</p>
  <p>so if anyone has had contact with this asshole</p>
  <p>please know that i am doing what it takes to get him to stop carrying</p>
  <p>on in this way</p>
  <p>on a brighter note</p>
  <p>i am down in australia getting ready to begin our tour down here</p>

      <p>hi</p>
      <p>dec 8 over here in austria</p>
      <p>its very late at night</p>
      <p>528 am to be exact</p>
      <p>been watching the news</p>
      <p>i must say this whole war in iraq has seemed to move a modicum in a</p>
      <p>more positive direction</p>
      <p>with this study group's report that talking to people and trying</p>
      <p>diplomacy</p>
      <p>might be better than silence and rhetoric and the threat of violence</p>
      <p>certainly a dialogue with iran and syria is better than none</p>
      <p>if there was one problem worked out through the course of dialogue</p>
      <p>then it would be worth it</p>
      <p>talking can only help</p>
      <p>and even for those people who think it is of paramount importance for</p>
      <p>the u.s.a. to be the biggest political and economic influence in the</p>
      <p>world</p>
      <p>surely they can see that continuing this absurd war in iraq in the</p>
      <p>current manner has only diminished respect and influence for the</p>
      <p>united states world wide</p>
      <p>of course, invading iraq was a catastrophic mistake from the get go</p>
      <p>but at least this report being taken seriously by the united states</p>
      <p>government is a small step in the right direction</p>
      <p>the invasion of iraq was a moronic move that made the world a much</p>
      <p>less safe and less happy place to be</p>
      <p>and the hugest blunder of the united states during my life</p>
      <p>time...........well i guess vietnam was a pretty bad waste of lives</p>
      <p>too..........</p>
      <p>this war has done nothing to stop terrorism it has only made it worse</p>
      <p>on the tragic day when al qaeda took out the twin towers</p>
      <p>a day that pains all of our hearts</p>
      <p>al qaeda and osama bin laden were pointed out as the perpetrators and</p>
      <p>we were told by our government they would be brought to justice</p>
      <p>so they invaded iraq whose government had nothing to do with al qaeda</p>
      <p>or with any radical religious fanaticism at all</p>
      <p>under false pretenses, and made up lies about the weapons of mass</p>
      <p>
        destruction they were supposed to have which were a threat to the u.s.a.
      </p>
      <p>which iraq had none of</p>
      <p>so they bomb the hell out of iraq</p>
      <p>then they find saddam hussein in a hole with some snickers bars and</p>
      <p>it is supposed to have some bearing on the terrible tragedy of sept</p>
      <p>11th??????</p>
      <p>something to do with stopping terrorism?</p>
      <p>after sept 11th, the world felt for the united states, the sane world</p>
      <p>cared about us</p>
      <p>until the bush operation awe and kill or whatever the hell it was</p>
      <p>called........</p>
      <p>iraq was a sanctioned to death country which was no threat to the</p>
      <p>u.s. at all, not to mention led by a secular government...</p>
      <p>and yes, a lunatic of a leader who ruled his country in a terrible</p>
      <p>way.......were they invading iraq to save the locals from the evil</p>
      <p>saddam?</p>
      <p>if so......where was our caring government during the genocide in</p>
      <p>rwanda not so many years before?</p>
      <p>or in darfur now?</p>
      <p>geez....anyone who has paid any attention at all knows all this stuff</p>
      <p>so why am i still blabbing on about it?</p>
      <p>because thousands and thousands of people die violently for a lie?</p>
      <p>and it continues unabated?</p>
      <p>because for some reason completely beyond me there are those out</p>
      <p>there who still think the invasion of iraq was somehow justified</p>
      <p>aaaahhhhhh</p>
      <p>anyways, maybe the u.s.a. can train these iraqi troops and leave a</p>
      <p>place they have had no business being in the first place</p>
      <p>maybe it is possible for people to have peace over there</p>
      <p>maybe they can have their own government</p>
      <p>maybe</p>
      <p>maybe love is better than war</p>
      <p>maybe diplomacy is better than dropping bombs on human beings</p>
      <p>maybe there doesn't need to be bodies of disfigured children lying in</p>
      <p>the street</p>
      <p>maybe a tenth of the effort put into something as ridiculous as the</p>
      <p>war in iraq</p>
      <p>put into trying to create peace and understanding</p>
      <p>could have a positive effect</p>
      <p>maybe the united states which i love so much</p>
      <p>could have a department of peace</p>
      <p>as well as a department of war</p>

      <p>hi</p>
      <p>i love the beautiful thing in everyone</p>
      <p>i love the freedom of everyone to be beautiful</p>
      <p>i love the miracle of someone expressing their beautiful self</p>
      <p>i weep with joy at the power of someone able to express their true</p>
      <p>beauty in the midst of repressive forces</p>
      <p>we have to all support the freedom and the beauty</p>
      <p>it is our responsibility as human beings</p>
      <p>it is the greatest thing we can do</p>
      <p>our imagination is our greatest gift</p>
      <p>i am in vienna</p>
      <p>i purchased a nice jacket and waistcoat today</p>
      <p>it feels so good the coziness of it</p>
      <p>the red hot chili peppers have played a lot of concerts</p>
      <p>wow</p>
      <p>it is hard to imagine for me</p>
      <p>even though i lived every single one</p>
      <p>all the sweat and broken toes</p>
      <p>all the rubber chicken necking</p>
      <p>all the smiles</p>
      <p>the sheer quantity of notes</p>
      <p>and we played another one tonight in vienna</p>
      <p>i am so proud of my bandmates</p>
      <p>they always give their hearts</p>
      <p>and i am so lucky to have ended up with them</p>
      <p>tonight we played a little bit of the song 'nevermind'</p>
      <p>we haven't played that song in many a moon</p>
      <p>i cant remember the last time</p>
      <p>but it was so fun</p>
      <p>CAUSE WERE THE REDHOT CHILI PEPP ERRRRRRSSS!!!!!!!!</p>
      <p>yeah it goes like that</p>
      <p>there is a man with a red face who works here at the hotel</p>
      <p>and whores in the bar</p>
      <p>mozart is from around here</p>
      <p>not from vienna but somewhere in austria</p>
      <p>i am listening to ornette coleman right now 'love call'</p>
      <p>whooo that dude is on fire</p>
      <p>harmolodics</p>
      <p>cant beat it</p>
      <p>cant</p>
      <p>impossible</p>
      <p>has anyone seen the tv show 'the wire'?</p>
      <p>anthony turned me on to it and i have been watching it with great</p>
      <p>fervor</p>
      <p>there is an awesome character in it named d'angelo</p>
      <p>the actor who plays him is great</p>
      <p>and undergoes an incredible transformation</p>
      <p>as far as the 3 seasons i have seen he is the emotional center of the</p>
      <p>whole thing</p>
      <p>i really love it</p>
      <p>though it is completely heartbreaking</p>
      <p>and supports joe strummer's assertion that '"it is a sad and</p>
      <p>beautiful world"</p>

      <p>so i see that snoop dogg has been arrested again......</p>
      <p>let me tell you this</p>
      <p>i have a non profit music school in los angeles</p>
      <p>it is called 'the silverlake conservatory of music'</p>
      <p>we have about 600 students and lots of them go for free and and are</p>
      <p>supplied with quality instruments to play</p>
      <p>it costs money to make this happen</p>
      <p>last summer i asked snoop dogg if he would come down and record with</p>
      <p>the kids in the studio</p>
      <p>
        a bunch of kids got in the studio over at capital records in hollywood
      </p>
      <p>and snoop doggy dogg the dee oh double g came down</p>
      <p>and met with each kid individually, took pictures with all of them</p>
      <p>signed all their autographs</p>
      <p>and the kids rocked some funk grooves and snoop rocked rhymes with</p>
      <p>them and it was recorded</p>
      <p>he spent several hours doing it</p>
      <p>and he showed them how he did it in the studio</p>
      <p>for free</p>
      <p>he was gracious, polite, and giving with the kids</p>
      <p>and he had a gig that night that he had to get a plane to, but he</p>
      <p>still showed up and spent the whole day with the kids</p>
      <p>because he cared</p>
      <p>there was no press, nothing to gain, no glory</p>
      <p>he did it because it was the thing a person with heart does</p>
      <p>and the recording was great and it will come out sometime soon and</p>
      <p>raise money for the school</p>
      <p>so kids that can't afford it can have free quality music lessons and</p>
      <p>instruments</p>
      <p>there you have it</p>

      <p>hi</p>
      <p>today i am in grand rapids, michigan</p>
      <p>
        it is the hometown of my very close friend of many years, anthony kiedis
      </p>
      <p>today is his birthday</p>
      <p>i love him so much and on this day i feel very grateful for our</p>
      <p>friendship</p>
      <p>he and i together have created lots of things</p>
      <p>we created a way to steal from supermarkets and sneak into movie</p>
      <p>theaters and skip out on restaurant checks when we were kids</p>
      <p>then as we learned better, and were students of the kharmic lessons</p>
      <p>that life gave us</p>
      <p>
        we created ways to try to improve ourselves and be honest giving people
      </p>
      <p>we jumped off many a hollywood apartment building roof top into the</p>
      <p>swimming pool below</p>
      <p>
        we went to many a punk rock concert and danced like untethered animals
      </p>
      <p>we slept in toolsheds and bushes on the side of the road</p>
      <p>we hitch hiked all around the place</p>
      <p>when i was pulling into grand rapids on my big fancy tour bus today</p>
      <p>i remembered when i came from los angeles on the greyhound bus to</p>
      <p>grand rapids</p>
      <p>it took 5 days and nights of sitting up on that damn bus</p>
      <p>to visit anthony who was staying at his mother's house for the summer</p>
      <p>and we jumped repeatedly of a train track bridge into a river</p>
      <p>it was fun</p>
      <p>except anthony got to go back to los angeles on an aeroplane</p>
      <p>and i had to ride that damn stinky greyhound bus</p>
      <p>i am so lucky to have found a friend as great as him when i was a kid</p>
      <p>and we got to create so many beautiful things together</p>
      <p>and here we are today in grand rapids, michigan</p>
      <p>and we are gonna create one more beautiful thing tomorrow night at</p>
      <p>the van andel arena</p>

    <p>hi world</p>
    <p>i love you</p>
    <p>you sad and beautiful thing</p>
    <p>i am here in new orleans having arrived early this morning from</p>
    <p>driving through the night from atlanta</p>
    <p>before atlanta we drove from philly</p>
    <p>some big drives lately a good time for reading and movie watching</p>
    <p>last night john and i watched the movie 'slacker'</p>
    <p>we liked it alot and it was great to hear the butthole surfers</p>
    <p>i love the butthole surfers</p>
    <p>their records 'rembrant pussyhorse' and 'cream corn from the socket</p>
    <p>of davis' were never far from my turntable</p>
    <p>when they came out.......</p>
    <p>they also put on some of the most awesome rock shows i ever saw in my</p>
    <p>life</p>
    <p>and without doubt the best visuals of any rock show i ever saw</p>
    <p>they once had a dancer who danced for the whole show</p>
    <p>she came out naked, painted green, and with tin foil over her teeth</p>
    <p>and they would reflect all the lights</p>
    <p>she was great and the music was true psychedelia and paul leary such</p>
    <p>a great guitarist.......</p>
    <p>king and theresa on the skins</p>
    <p>gibby waling</p>
    <p>and jeff was a great bass player</p>
    <p>and they had a dog named mark farner</p>
    <p>real psychedelic</p>
    <p>not some wimpy 60's retro cartoon</p>
    <p>not in any way am i dissing the mind boggling power of 60's</p>
    <p>psychedelia, but the 60's was the sixties....................it ended</p>
    <p>punk rock happened</p>
    <p>hip hop happened</p>
    <p>anyways</p>
    <p>so we got into new orleans early in the morn and i was met by my</p>
    <p>loved ones here and my was heart was lifted</p>
    <p>it has been a great 24 hours</p>
    <p>there are great things afoot in chili pepper land</p>
    <p>tomorrow we play at the voodoo fest here and the meters are playing</p>
    <p>as well</p>
    <p>i love the meters so much</p>
    <p>i have learned a lot from them</p>
    <p>we are going to jam with them at the end of our set</p>
    <p>that is very exciting to me</p>
    <p>they are such innovative and important musicians who are one of the</p>
    <p>main inventors of this music we call funk</p>
    <p>the deepest kind of groove that could have only come from those guys</p>
    <p>in this town</p>
    <p>art neville! leo noscetelli! george porter!</p>
    <p>ziggy modeliste!!!!</p>
    <p>whooooooooo hooooooooo yeeeeeeeaaaaaahhh!!!!</p>
    <p>so it is an honor to play with them</p>
    <p>the other exciting thing that is on the horizon for us</p>
    <p>is that we are going to make a video for the song 'hump de bump'</p>
    <p>and it is going to be directed by someone we truly admire and respect</p>
    <p>the comic genius chris rock</p>
    <p>he has been so supportive of us</p>
    <p>and it is a kind thing</p>
    <p>for him to take the time to direct this piece of film for us</p>
    <p>for someone who works as hard as he does</p>
    <p>and is as insightful and as on top of their game as he is</p>
    <p>and who has an incredible gift of being able to give hysterical joy</p>
    <p>to as many people as he does</p>
    <p>to associate himself with us in this working enviroment</p>
    <p>we are grateful......................</p>
    <p>and it gonna be as fonky as fuck.....</p>
    <p>yeeeah</p>
    <p>it is pretty heavy to be here in new orleans</p>
    <p>it has always been such a magical and mysterious place</p>
    <p>the home of such great music</p>
    <p>and history</p>
    <p>louis armstrong</p>
    <p>bunk johnson</p>
    <p>buddy bolden (read 'coming through slaughter' by michael ondaajte)</p>
    <p>it is heavy to realize how much the people here have had to sacrifice</p>
    <p>because of hurricane katrina</p>
    <p>and how much they continue to sacrifice every day</p>
    <p>
      anything anyone can do to help out with the people here they should do
    </p>
    <p>habitat for humanity is a great charity that helps a lot.....</p>
    <p>thanks for reading</p>
    <p>i'll try to write more</p>
    <p>but i wont make any more promises that i dont keep</p>

    <p>hi</p>
    <p>we just played our first show of the new leg at meadowlands in</p>
    <p>rutherford new jersey</p>
    <p>have you noticed that i dont like punctuation</p>
    <p>and i am a sloppy typer</p>
    <p>it really is kind of a shame</p>
    <p>because</p>
    <p>though i chalk it up to style</p>
    <p>it is actually a bastardization of the english language</p>
    <p>and when i read books from hundreds of years ago</p>
    <p>the language is so beautiful and expressive</p>
    <p>and even the common man spoke with and eloquence and poetry that is</p>
    <p>absent from our language now</p>
    <p>which has turned into slang and people saying the fewest possible</p>
    <p>words that they use to unimaginatively get their idea across</p>
    <p>and because of this the quality of the ideas also suffer</p>
    <p>the depth of language definitely contributes to the depth of the idea</p>
    <p>yet i continue to use no punctuation</p>
    <p>and i dont speak that well either</p>
    <p>i say fuck and shit all the time</p>
    <p>show was pretty fun tonight</p>
    <p>everyone had little penlights that they lit up and it was pretty it</p>
    <p>looked like a van gogh starry sky</p>
    <p>fuck i love van gogh</p>
    <p>i wish i could have cheered him up a little</p>
    <p>did you ever see that kurosawa movie 'dreams' where they go inside a</p>
    <p>van gogh painting?</p>
    <p>its cool</p>

      so here we are in new york city, fixin to get another leg of tour rollin
    </p>
    <p>i had a nice break</p>
    <p>i was close with my awesome family</p>
    <p>i am the luckiest man on earth</p>
    <p>the number one luckiest man on this earth</p>
    <p>there is love all around</p>
    <p>all in and around</p>
    <p>i also played golf til my arms nearly fell off</p>
    <p>al i want to do is play golf</p>
    <p>i just wanna stroll down that nice fairway</p>
    <p>and hit that little white ball</p>
    <p>i played with some kind and smart/funny people(hey raul! hey kennedy</p>
    <p>family!)</p>
    <p>and some kinda uptight squares</p>
    <p>but man</p>
    <p>it was fun</p>
    <p>i also had the privilege and honor of once again playing with patti</p>
    <p>smith</p>
    <p>and her band, lenny kaye, jay dee daugherty, and tony shanahan</p>
    <p>we played at cbgb's for the last night of the club ever</p>
    <p>and all i wanted to do was honor the great music that came out of</p>
    <p>that place in the 70's</p>
    <p>that shaped my idea of what music is</p>
    <p>and touched me in so many beautiful ways</p>
    <p>speaking of that</p>
    <p>i also got to play, while recording with patti, with the great</p>
    <p>guitarist tom verlaine</p>
    <p>i must confess i am a little intimidated by him</p>
    <p>i grew up admiring him so</p>
    <p>but it seemed to go pretty well</p>
    <p>anyways im going to eat eggs now</p>

    <p>ok so i said i would do a fleamail everyday and i missed yesterday...</p>
    <p>so i will do 2 on a day soon</p>
    <p>we flew to toronto from baltimore yesterday on an airplane</p>
    <p>we were gonna transport ourselves like jonathon livingston seagull</p>
    <p>but didnt feel like it</p>
    <p>we are on our 6th leg of tour now</p>
    <p>we are pretty deep into it</p>
    <p>a man can go through a lot of different states during a tour like</p>
    <p>this and i dont mean oregon arizona and idaho</p>
    <p>but we are holding up like champs</p>
    <p>and i feel like these are the best shows we have ever played</p>
    <p>i am happy with them</p>
    <p>
      as much as i value our creative process of writing and recording music
    </p>
    <p>and all of the preparation and pre show rituals</p>
    <p>and the discipline and work it takes to put on our shows</p>
    <p>and the fun that we have surrendering to the music when we truly</p>
    <p>surrender completely</p>
    <p>i give those things no more value than i give to the process that all</p>
    <p>the people have</p>
    <p>who get in their cars with their families and friends and make it</p>
    <p>down to the gig to see us play</p>
    <p>every night i give a talk about how grateful we are for everyone</p>
    <p>coming and giving our music life</p>
    <p>i hope people understand how much i and we as a group deeply feel</p>
    <p>that gratitude</p>
    <p>we are all together on this</p>
    <p>these gatherings each night are unbelievably great</p>
    <p>all of us together</p>
    <p>thank you</p>

    <p>so we have been here in new york for a few days</p>
    <p>i have been lying pretty low</p>
    <p>just tooling around a little bit</p>
    <p>i went to see pearl jam last night</p>
    <p>and they were great</p>
    <p>it makes me so happy to see our contemporaries</p>
    <p>after several years have rolled by</p>
    <p>rocking better than ever</p>
    <p>they continue to write good songs</p>
    <p>they hit it hard and raw</p>
    <p>and the sound of eddie vedder's voice fills me up with hope</p>
    <p>after the other morning when i found out our record had leaked</p>
    <p>i freaked</p>
    <p>it leaked i freaked</p>
    <p>after calming down a little bit</p>
    <p>and finding out more about what actually happens</p>
    <p>it has been bought to my attention by some intelligent people</p>
    <p>that most of the people who down load the record before it comes out</p>
    <p>are people who really love our music and believe in what we do</p>
    <p>and they go out and get the real thing anyway</p>
    <p>but of course they can not wait to hear it</p>
    <p>and are willing to hear a substandard version first</p>
    <p>because they are excited to hear it</p>
    <p>and of course i understand and i would do the same thing</p>
    <p>it just really scared me that people would be hearing something</p>
    <p>without the depth of sound that we strive for</p>
    <p>well we are playing saturday night live tonight</p>
    <p>i am excited about it</p>
    <p>and i dedicate our performance to john belushi</p>
    <p>the great performer</p>
    <p>and cultural treasure</p>
    <p>produced by the united states</p>
    <p>who made so many people happy</p>
    <p>in front of their televisions</p>

    <p><strong>(PART 2)</p>
    <p>well ya know</p>
    <p>i have been reading all the reviews that have been coming out about</p>
    <p>our new record</p>
    <p>some are good</p>
    <p>actually most are really good</p>
    <p>and few are bad</p>
    <p>i am the freak in the band that reads all this stuff</p>
    <p>i dont know why</p>
    <p>i just like to</p>
    <p>sometimes they are really mean spirited where they will make a</p>
    <p>personal attack against one of us</p>
    <p>but i guess when ya put your heart out there</p>
    <p>that is part of the deal</p>
    <p>there was one review by an english newspaper</p>
    <p>where the guy really hated us</p>
    <p>and it was full of insults and descriptions about how terrible and</p>
    <p>worthless we are and how inane our music is</p>
    <p>and the guy mentioned that nick cave really thought we were a shitty</p>
    <p>band</p>
    <p>and printed a quote that nick cave had said in that regard</p>
    <p>for a second that hurt my feelings</p>
    <p>because i love nick cave</p>
    <p>i have all of his records</p>
    <p>i love the birthday party</p>
    <p>
      and i love the bad seeds with and without blixa bargeld but mostly with
    </p>
    <p>and mick harvey is an outstanding musician</p>
    <p>and i lie on the floor and completely open myself to those records</p>
    <p>and i let them wash all through me</p>
    <p>because they are beautiful</p>
    <p>and i dont care if nick cave hates my band</p>
    <p>because his music means everything to me</p>
    <p>because he is one of my favorite songwriters and singers and</p>
    <p>musicians of all time</p>
    <p>and i love all the incarnations of the bad seeds</p>
    <p>and i rock out to 'from her to eternity'</p>
    <p>and cry to the songs on 'nocturama'</p>
    <p>and when 'murder ballads' came out</p>
    <p>i listened to it with all of me</p>
    <p>and i had terrible nightmares for a week and woke up convinced</p>
    <p>someone was lurking in the dark about to kill me</p>
    <p>but i still listened to it because it was so deeply great</p>
    <p>but it only hurt my feelings for a second</p>
    <p>because my love is bigger than all that shit</p>
    <p>and if he thinks my band is lame</p>
    <p>that's o.k.</p>
    <p>ya know i respect nick cave so much</p>
    <p>he is the real deal</p>
    <p>and his music works on so many levels, visceral, spiritual,</p>
    <p>intellectual, and they are sonically exciting</p>
    <p>and my band, well, we grew up our group of friends</p>
    <p>the way we are</p>
    <p>
      and we just sound like what we do when we get together and start playing
    </p>
    <p>and i love who we are</p>
    <p>so i still love nick cave anyways</p>
    <p>and no asshole journalist can ever take that away from me</p>

    <p>when i woke up this morning</p>
    <p>i was was confronted with the news that our record has been leaked to</p>
    <p>the internet</p>
    <p>it does not come out til may 9 but now it has leaked</p>
    <p>and not that i know alot about this kind of thing</p>
    <p>but i guess now it is possible to down load it for free if you want</p>
    <p>well</p>
    <p>that's not very nice</p>
    <p>if you down load it now off one of these file sharing sites</p>
    <p>you will be getting a pale imitation of the record</p>
    <p>it will be of the poor sound quality of the technique they used to</p>
    <p>get it on there</p>
    <p>and that will break my heart</p>
    <p>it will break john frusciante's heart</p>
    <p>it will break anthony kiedis's heart</p>
    <p>and it will break the heart of chad smith</p>
    <p>yes, we worked for a year and a half to make the epic record of our</p>
    <p>lives</p>
    <p>and it is sad to me for the business reasons of course</p>
    <p>i think we are selling something really cool and we put all we had</p>
    <p>into it, 28 songs, 2 hours of the best that we can offer</p>
    <p>and i think it is a fair deal for everyone</p>
    <p>
      and for people to just steal a poor sound quality version of it for free
    </p>
    <p>because some asshole stole it and put it on the internet</p>
    <p>is sad to me</p>
    <p>but, equitable business reasons aside</p>
    <p>the thing that really bums me out is</p>
    <p>we worked so hard, and so thoughtfully, all of us, for so long</p>
    <p>to make this record sound as warm and full from top to bottom</p>
    <p>as was possible</p>
    <p>we spent day and night for a year making sure every little sound was</p>
    <p>just right</p>
    <p>that they were all put together in the most beautiful way we could</p>
    <p>we did not leave a stone unturned in doing that work</p>
    <p>i can not put in words how much this record, stadium arcadium, means</p>
    <p>to us</p>
    <p>how sacred the sound of it is to us</p>
    <p>and how many sleepless nights and hardworking days we all had</p>
    <p>thinking about how to make it be the best sounding thing we could</p>
    <p>and now, for someone to take it and put it out there with this poor</p>
    <p>sound quality</p>
    <p>it is a painful pill for us to swallow</p>
    <p>let me tell you</p>
    <p>this bums all of us out</p>
    <p>and i know that, as sensitive as john frusciante is about sound</p>
    <p>the idea of anyone getting and hearing this thing that way</p>
    <p>will devastate him</p>
    <p>for people to not hear the work the way we meant it to be</p>
    <p>will really hurt him deep inside</p>
    <p>and all of us will hurt</p>
    <p>yes, it is stealing from us, and that is lame</p>
    <p>everyone has to live with their own conscience on that one</p>
    <p>let it be your guide</p>
    <p>but to take a version that has been defiled sound wise</p>
    <p>a version in which some idiot has taken our year and a half of soul</p>
    <p>baring work and pissed all over it</p>
    <p>that will break our hearts</p>
    <p>sincerely,</p>
    <p>flea</p>

    <p>played a french t.v. show today</p>
    <p>it was called tarata</p>
    <p>it was a weird set up we played then waited an hour then played again</p>
    <p>but the people were nice and it seemed they were really about music</p>
    <p>i dont know what is was called though</p>
    <p>i love william blake so much</p>
    <p>well i wrote that quite a few days ago</p>
    <p>since then we have been to copenhagen and rocked our brains out</p>
    <p>and hamburg where we also rocked our asses into dirt</p>
    <p>and cologne where we played one song on a t.v show</p>
    <p>and that was a surreal experience</p>
    <p>it was a talk show host whose name i forget but i think he is very</p>
    <p>popular in germany</p>
    <p>he was a nice man</p>
    <p>and when we talked about the band 'defunkt'</p>
    <p>he knew who they were and had seen them play</p>
    <p>and i was very impressed with him for that</p>
    <p>because defunkt is a pretty obscure band</p>
    <p>but anthony and i loved them so much and they were really influential</p>
    <p>on us when we started</p>
    <p>we used to listen to their record 'defunkt' all the time and dance</p>
    <p>around skoods living room or wherever we were like crazy</p>
    <p>we just danced and danced</p>
    <p>and the playing is so great on that record y'all should get it</p>
    <p>the leader of the band is joe bowie a trombonist who's brother is</p>
    <p>lester the bowie the trumpet player of the 'art ensemble of chicago'</p>
    <p>a great and free jazz group</p>
    <p>but defunkt is hardcore funk and it drove us crazy</p>
    <p>we really loved the guitar playing of kelvin bell</p>
    <p>the very first song that we ever wrote called 'out in l.a.' was born</p>
    <p>from me doing my best to copy the groove of the song 'defunkt' off of</p>
    <p>the album 'defunkt'</p>
    <p>john frusciante told me that henry rollins says that the defunkt</p>
    <p>album 'thermonuclear sweat' is better than the album defunkt</p>
    <p>but i say hogwash</p>
    <p>it is not better</p>
    <p>anyways we were on that show in germany</p>
    <p>and it was cool</p>
    <p>but we were anxious to get to italy so we hightailed it last night to</p>
    <p>milan</p>
    <p>and i ate spaghetti and watched the anchor man had some silly laughs</p>
    <p>and went to bed</p>
    <p>i then went out this morning and bought a dress for my daughter and</p>
    <p>now i am back in this hotel room listening to herbie hancock</p>
    <p>i still love william blake alot</p>
    <p>i have been looking at all his art it is so great</p>
    <p>you can find lots of it on the internet</p>
    <p>i wonder if it is possible for anyone to be so pure and great and</p>
    <p>powerful in this modern world...</p>
    <p>actually patti smith is</p>
    <p>also i saw a thing on t.v. this morning about a young boy who had</p>
    <p>muscular dystrophy</p>
    <p>he died in his teen years and he was a poet</p>
    <p>and his poems spoke of yearning for peace and unity among all of us</p>
    <p>and of strength of spirit</p>
    <p>i cant remember his name because i am a dope</p>
    <p>
      jimmy carter and maya angelou were on cnn talking about him this morning
    </p>
    <p>and when they read his poems i wept because they were so fucking good</p>
    <p>maya angelou gave the best parenting advice i ever heard</p>
    <p>she said</p>
    <p>'your only job as a parent, is to see the sun rise and set every time</p>
    <p>your child walks into the room'</p>

    <p>hi</p>
    <p>we just played in paris tonight</p>
    <p>i love to see people smile</p>
    <p>i stayed in my room all day because i needed to rest</p>
    <p>i know it is lazy, but it was time for abject laziness</p>
    <p>and last night i watched flight plan with jodi foster</p>
    <p>it was kind of interesting and a little predictable</p>
    <p>but i just love jodie foster</p>
    <p>i always have</p>
    <p>when i first met my wife we watched 'little man tate'</p>
    <p>the summer before last anthony and i and some friends went hiking in</p>
    <p>yosemite national park</p>
    <p>that is a great place</p>
    <p>the mountains are high and the rivers are clear and deep and the</p>
    <p>bears will eat your food or even you if you don't watch out</p>
    <p>and the trees are so plentiful except when you get above the</p>
    <p>timberline but that's ok cause then you have a view of the pristine</p>
    <p>majesty that goes for ever and ever</p>
    <p>i have had some of the greatest moments of my life hiking up there</p>
    <p>when i have become so small that i got smaller and smaller til i</p>
    <p>disappeared into the beauty of it all and i didn't even exist in this</p>
    <p>dimension</p>
    <p>i hope i have grandkids and great grandkids and that we all party</p>
    <p>together</p>
    <p>and read books and tell jokes in front of the firelace</p>
    <p>that sounds so fun</p>
    <p>and if all goes well i will wear nice old suits and have a long</p>
    <p>silver beard and read proust and have lots of love in my heart and</p>
    <p>not be bitter</p>
    <p>just be forgiving and full of joy and love</p>
    <p>and still swim in the ocean</p>
    <p>isn't it nice when you meet an old person like that?</p>
    <p>i just got out of the bath tub</p>
    <p>i was already in bed but thought i might stay awake for a while so i</p>
    <p>got in the tub</p>
    <p>i played brickbreaker in the tub on my blackberry</p>
    <p>i could have been contemplating the composing of the best music i</p>
    <p>ever wrote but instead i played brickbreaker on my blackberry</p>
    <p>i like the french names for girls like</p>
    <p>claudette</p>
    <p>collette</p>
    <p>odette</p>
    <p>babette</p>
    <p>babette was a she male who man ray took pictures of</p>
    <p>and who jean cocteau put in his film black orpheus</p>
    <p>she/he looked great but she must have also been cool as hell to to</p>
    <p>end up working with both those guys</p>
    <p>collette is a writer who i like</p>
    <p>odette is a lady who works at the spa here in the hotel</p>
    <p>i suggested an 'ette' name for my baby girl before she was born but</p>
    <p>my wife wasn't having it</p>
    <p>that's great cause then we got the name sunny!</p>
    <p>and she is a little sunny for sure</p>
    <p>well i'm going back to bed</p>

    <p>george w bush should definitely be impeached</p>
    <p>he is a liar</p>
    <p>and his lies have bought misery to millions of people</p>
    <p>and bought no good to anyone except for the corporate oil</p>
    <p>billionaires who are making huge profits</p>
    <p>they are profiting during wartime</p>
    <p>that is unscrupulous and terribly sad</p>
    <p>w bush has made the world a much less safe place</p>
    <p>before the war iraq was not a place for terrorists</p>
    <p>saddam hussein, brutal dictator that he was was secular and had</p>
    <p>nothing to do with al queda</p>
    <p>and was sanctioned to death and had no power outside of his country</p>
    <p>now it is a breeding ground for terrorism and anti-americanism is at</p>
    <p>an all time high all over the world</p>
    <p>and the people of iraq are no better off at all</p>
    <p>all those people want is for the americans to leave</p>
    <p>decent families and people like you and i who never wanted america</p>
    <p>there in the first place</p>
    <p>goerge w bush has sent american soldiers over there to be maimed and</p>
    <p>killed</p>
    <p>only to serve his selfish oil company needs and for his ego</p>
    <p>american soldiers who are loyal to each other and who only want to</p>
    <p>have a good job get an education and support their country are being</p>
    <p>used for an unjust cause</p>
    <p>i support the troops</p>
    <p>they, like all americans are being betrayed by george w bush</p>
    <p>he has betrayed his country he should be impeached</p>
    <p>the administration's line that they were over there because they</p>
    <p>wanted to spread democracy and freedom</p>
    <p>is nothing else besides a lie</p>
    <p>
      if they had any interest at all in the well being of other human beings
    </p>
    <p>they would be doing what they could for people who desperately need</p>
    <p>and would love help in africa</p>
    <p>i pray to god that george w bush and his administration does not</p>
    <p>invade iran</p>
    <p>it would be a bloodbath</p>
    <p>why dont they just leave the iranians alone</p>
    <p>and go through the united nations</p>
    <p>
      and work on making the united nations as strong and as just as possible
    </p>
    <p>
      an invasion of iran would be the worst possible thing that could happen

      I went to bed at 5 am and now it is just after ten but I woke up early and
      underslept as I almost always do on the last day of a tour, my head full
      of going home, of change, of dealing with all the things at home that I
      have not dealt with for so long while I lived in the alternate reality
      which is tour.
    </p>
    <p>
      18 months of touring this world. I have to say that it was the most
      consistent tour we have have ever done in terms of us staying together and
      sane and rocking at a high level that we have ever done. There were times
      when the things about it that I don't like seemed unsurmountable to me and
      I just wanted to go home and be in the cradle of peace, but I, we, stuck
      it out and here we are a major accomplishment under our belt. (I am
      patting myself on the back as we speak) (and typing with the other hand).
    </p>
    <p>
      I am so happy that we got to play with so many great bands on this tour.
      Not counting the ones who were on the big festivals, but the ones we
      really toured with they were:
    </p>
    <p>The Mars Volta</p>
    <p>Mike Watt and the Secondmen</p>
    <p>The Toilet Boys</p>
    <p>The Flaming Lips</p>
    <p>The Queens of the Stone Age</p>
    <p>French Toast</p>
    <p>Snoop Dogg</p>
    <p>Quirk</p>
    <p>POD</p>
    <p>the amazing travelling dingleberries</p>
    <p>
      There are probably some that I am forgetting right now. After all i just
      finished touring the world and I have only slept a wee bit. I am also very
      grateful our crew. They are such a family to us. Everyone that ever is
      around us or associated with us, other bands, or people we run in to, who
      are familiar with the touring world always say we have the nicest and
      caring crew who try to make everyone else's life easier and who do there
      job at the highest standard and take pride in it.
    </p>
    <p>They are</p>
    <p>
      Lois Mathieu.....our tourmanager, boss and overseer of the whole shebang.
      He organizes everything puts up with us at our worst, brings us things to
      our rooms when we wake him up at 4 in the morning and works unbelievably
      hard with love and dedication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa Bloom...makes our life at the gig easy and comfortable, she works so
      hard for us and takes care everyday going up and beyond the call of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dave Rat...Rocks our sound that you hear at the gigs, he is the best in
      the world at his job. Everyone who I respect always tell me that our sound
      is perfect, best as it can be, "better than the other last zillion bands
      that came through here..." not because of our playing but because of him
      capturing it with clarity and power.
    </p>
    <p>Dave Lee..does John's guitars</p>
    <p>
      Chris Warren.... Does Chad's drums, Chad says he is the best of all time
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy robar, .....the reliable chap who makes my basses and amps work
      great every night
    </p>
    <p>George Squires........does our monitors so we can rock with ourselves</p>
    <p>
      Gage Freeman who is louis assistant and my biggest boggle foe and
      disagreer about shak
    </p>
    <p>Scott Holthaus who makes are lights look good and has beautiful twins</p>
    <p>
      Bill Rahmy when I first met him he was dressed in trash bags and he is
      about 7 feet tall it was quite a sight
    </p>
    <p>Artie Freund</p>
    <p>Tim Shanahan who always has a good vibe</p>
    <p>Marcelo Cacciaggoni</p>
    <p>Rodney Johnson</p>
    <p>Martin CapirasoRobbie Alvarez</p>
    <p>Ben Connor</p>
    <p>Brenda Byrnes</p>
    <p>Peter Baigent</p>
    <p>Nick Brisbois</p>
    <p>Andy Turner</p>
    <p>
      Fletch wasn't around lately but he was for a long time and he was nice
    </p>
    <p>Kevin McKenzie</p>
    <p>Don Jacobelly</p>
    <p>Blayne Partica</p>
    <p>Armondo Figueroa</p>
    <p>Liam Birt....</p>
    <p>Bruce French</p>
    <p>Scotty haulter</p>
    <p>Hal Hamer</p>
    <p>Geoff Daubner</p>
    <p>Bennie Johnson</p>
    <p>Scott Robertson</p>
    <p>Mickey Thompson</p>
    <p>Andy Davis</p>
    <p>Gregg Atkinson</p>
    <p>Jeff Link</p>
    <p>Scott Buckley</p>
    <p>Nick James</p>
    <p>Mike Anawaty</p>
    <p>Rick Miller</p>
    <p>Frank Heubsher</p>
    <p>
      and last but not least Sat Hari Khalsa who loves us and keeps us healthy
      and rockin'
    </p>
    <p>
      Some I know well, some I know by face and nod in the hallway only but all
      of them were vital in our being able to do what we just did. I am grateful
      to all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I get home tonight and I am gonna go the laker game. I am sad that Shak is
      kicking Kobe while he is down in a political power move because shak is a
      raving egomaniac. I am also sad that Kobe is reacting selfishly and
      childishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      anyways that's another story, it's what I get for having my emotions
      wrapped up in a professional sport full of over paid spoiled brats who are
      supremely talented.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have mentioned before, this last leg has been supremely great because
      of the presence of Mike Watt. His power and skill and passion are
      unrivaled and just being around him made me feel so good. I feel so lucky
      to have spent the time that i did around him this tour. He is someone who
      truly makes the world a better place.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have been going up and jamming with him. Anthony, who never does
      anything like that, I mean not right before we are about to go on, went up
      and rocked 'Sister Ray' last night. It was amazing. Mike Watt played bass
      with his teeth and behind his head like Jimi Hendrix. I overheard Anthony
      speaking to someone and he said "well if you were trying to get into
      heaven and they were looking at your list of stuff and it said 'refused to
      jam with Mike Watt' on there, it wouldn't look very good".
    </p>
    <p>
      I am gonna try to get a little more sleep. I don't have to go to the
      airport for 2 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      thank all of you with all my heart for your support.

      well i went back to sleep for 2 hours it was lucky. i am on the plane
      going to l.a. now. Dave Rat iis here with his beautiful little daughter
      Maddy whose twin sister is Samantha and so Dave who does our sound and
      Scott who does our lights both have twins!!!!!

      hi everyone.I am in Portland. The pacific Northwest where it smells clean
      and green. I am listening to Augustus Pablo. We played tonight at the
      Memorial Arena where the Trailblazers used to play when they had Clyde
      Drexler and shit.we had a fun gig, it was a great crowd. After the show it
      so happened that my friend Tree was in town. Tree is a great musician and
      he took me to a jazz club where I played trumpet and he played harmonica
      with the jazz musicians there. It was so much fun. I was so nervous
      because I always just play trumpet alone in my room or free form with Chad
      at our gigs. But this was playing with real jazz guys who speak the
      sophisticated language of jazz which I am not used to. I am learning it,
      it is another world. I was very scared and the first song we played was
      'Sunnymoon for Two' and i was too stiff to play well, I did ok but I
      didn't feel like i was in control and I kinda sucked actually. But then
      after that we played the song 'Milestones' and I felt more comfortable and
      thought I played pretty well. At least maybe not well, but well for me,
      like I felt like I was expressing who I was as opposed to stiffly playing
      the notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a big adventure for me. John came with me and he was very
      supportive. The place we played was called 'Produce Row'. Tree played so
      well, he is just a beautiful musician and he rocked Peter and the Wolf
      over blues changes it was fucking great. The other musicians there were
      really good, a sax player named shoehorn who can play sax and tap dance at
      the same time. The bass player sounded really great I didn't get his name
      but he sang along with his solos and they were way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any ways we have been on tour for a while. It was great to play at home in
      L.A. and around California. We have four more shows and then we are done
      with the whole By the Way era.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have been touring with Mike Watt and the Secondmen. I know that most of
      you don't get there early enough see the first band, but if you can you
      should really see Mike Watt play. He sounds so awesome, so pure so free so
      intense. man he is all that is right with rock music. See him while you
      can this life is over in a blink. Human expression, love love. everynight
      when he finishes his set he says "start your own band, paint your own
      picture, write your own book.,....a love supreme" Then they play 'A Love
      Supreme' by JOhn Coltrane over the P.A. system. I love him. He has been so
      nice to us I am so grateful to have him on the road with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course you all know how original and fine the Flaming Lips sound
      already. They rock nightly.
    </p>
    <p>Life is full of adventures and surprises. Go get 'em!</p>
    <p>love</p>

      hi. I am back in detroit. playing somewhere in Michigan tomorrow. I saw
      that movie 'Bowling fro Columbine' yesterday. It showed Michael Moore
      going and getting guns and ammo all over the place in Michigan. I guess
      there are a lot of guns here. The movie was funny but it made me sad. It
      is sad how little compassion there is in this country. We are all too
      scared of each other to be nice. People fall through the cracks and get
      desperate. man. Well at least we have basket ball and 'The Simpsons'. we
      played in Pittsburgh last night. The crowd was fucking cool.They seemed so
      happy and rocking. We had a fun show and played some good stuff but I
      think we are all getting a little tired and ready to go home for a break.
      It will not stop us from rocking full force the next two nights though,
      don't worry. We will rock like possessed maniacal freaks with the power of
      a heard of elephants charging off a cliff on LSD and then we will read
      poetry while in mid flight and we will like it. Gage got real ad during
      the boggle game today on the bus. I was laughing when he got mad and then
      he got even madder and stormed away from the boggle table. All over the
      word keno. A measley 2 points. Basketball season is coming up i can't
      wait. It's gonna be a weird laker season though. see ya oh by the way I am
      going on the chat room lately on our website if I Am there then we can
      chat

      one more thing. I was just on the chat room with DJ619. He wanted me to
      write a fleamail so he would know it was really me. He is a nice guy. He
      plays guitar and loves the Beatles. I told him to check out King Crimson.
      He likes ELO and I told him that John loves ELO too. i am gonna go play
      bass now goodnight.

      good morning red hot chili pepper fleamail readers. I just got up about a
      half hour ago. First I peed. Then I lay back down and thought about going
      back to sleep but it didn't happen so I got up and turned on my co puter
      then I brushed my teeth. Then I prayed. Then I went online and checked the
      L.A. Times to see if there was any basketball news. I found an article on
      the 6 day rookie camp that new players have to go to. I thought about how
      cool Bill Russell was even though he was an arch enemy of the Lakers. He
      has really aged well, I like the things he has to say, he has style and
      dignity. Then I packed and then I ordered blueberries. Then I sat down
      again and started typing this. I spend alot of time alone in hotel rooms.
      I went on the chili pepper chat room but noone was there. maybe I am doing
      it wrong or something I thought people went on that thing, they used to
      back in the day when I used to go on it and people didn't believe me.well,
      my blueberries will be here in minute I better go. a guy can really think
      about things when he spends enough time alone in a hotel room.

      Sitting here in Cleveland. Today I took a walk down to the railroad tracks
      near a big river, but I am so geographically inept that I don't know what
      the giant river that goes through this town is called. There are big
      bridges and they have that kind of set up where the bridges split in half
      and raise up when a boat goes through that is too tall. I didn't see it
      happen but it looked great anyways, the big beautiful metal structure. It
      was sunny and the sun felt great on my skin especially after being indoors
      all the time during this tour. I walked past the Gund arena where Lebron
      James is gonna play. Lebron James is a fucking badass. I saw him play in
      the Macdonald's all american thing and he was unbelievable. The placed we
      played tonight was a really nice building. It is called Blossom something
      and the stage has really nice wood all around and above it. Wood is so
      nice to be around. The problem is that we are running out of trees and the
      logging companies need to not clearcut. If only they wouldn't be so greedy
      and they would just take some of the trees in an area and wait for more to
      grow. I am reading a biography of Neil Young I am really enjoying it. I
      love Neil Young. We have been touring around for quite some time now. I
      like to see French toast they open for us and the Queens and they rock in
      a cool arty style that reminds me of when I used to go see tripped out art
      band all the time at the Brave Dog and Al's bar in L.A. in 1980/81. That
      beautiful adventurous spirit harnessed with great taste and refined
      aesthetic sense....ahhh.... I saw a great movie called 'Dirty Pretty
      Things' about some illegal immigrants in London. About underdogs. I loved
      it and I loved the people in it.

      good morning. we played outside of Washington D.C. last night and it went
      pretty well.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was a little self conscious because I didn't play bass for ten days
      before this show and my hands were a wee bit stiff. It worked out o.k.
      though. I didn't play bass because I was playing trumpet all the time. My
      trumpet looks so beautiful to me. The machinery of it the glistening
      silver the though of all the work that went into making it the
      craftmanship the history the tradition I love it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone seemed pretty happy with our show last night. We ate good food
      with friends afterwards. I came back to the Four Seasons and listened to
      Albert Ayler and pondered the freedom of his music and wondered about his
      mysterious death. He was found floating in the river in N.Y.C. I think it
      is called the East river. I love Albert Ayler and John Coltrane loved him
      too. John Coltrane supported him and helped him alot. I listened to the
      album 'Love Call'. I am listening to Augustus Pablo now. when I was at
      home I listened to a lot of new c.d.'s that I got. I made some great new
      finds. One was Baden Powell the great Brazilian guitarist who lived in
      France for a long time. His playing was so beautiful. Another one was the
      new Nick Cave album 'Nocturna' man it is a beautiful record. And don't
      forget Dennis Brown the great reggae singer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we last played in Glasgow a couple of weeks ago Polly Harvey watched
      us play I wonder what she thought. Maybe she thought we were a great
      exciting adventurous band and maybe she thought we were a bunch of
      showboating assholes. Ha ha ha haaa!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well my melon just arrived from room service. A nice man named Sangia
      bought it to me. He had a little dandruff on his suit, I wonder if he is
      getting enough fatty acids in his diet.

      well so i've been writing some of these fleamails but Blackie is
      galavanting around the British isles and you're not seeing them til later.
      I am in Dublin. Tomorrow we are playing for 80,000 people at Slane Castle.
      It is the biggest show we have ever headlined in our entire career. That's
      a lot of Irish people. Since I am one quarter irish then that makes it
      80,000 and one quarter that will be partying. My great great grandmother
      came from Ireland to Australia during the potato famine and met my
      Hungarian great great grandfather who had just arrived there also. They
      got married a few days later so the story goes. They must have fallen love
      quickly. I remember hearing Sinead O'connor saying ina song once that
      there really was no potato famine that the Irish people were just being
      starved on purpose by the English, don't remember the exact story but
      whatever it was I will go with Sinead's version because I have always
      loved her and she has always been one of my favorite singers. even the
      records of big bands doing standards and the ones of traditional Irish
      music. I think she rocks. So anyways it is a big show tomorrow in Ireland.
      The foo's and the Queens and P.J. Harvey are playing too and a band called
      Feeder that I don't know about. I hope I get to see P.J. Harvey because
      her band is amazing right now and she is an all time great. And the Queens
      too because Nick Oliveri rocks. I think I already might have railed on
      about how great P.J. Harvey sounds right now so I will spare you. I will
      just think it while I type and not say anything about all about the heavy
      rock going down.

      Yesterday we played in Duisberg, Germany. We started the day in Berlin
      then flew to Duisberg and when we got there it was an old weird abandoned
      steel factory and was crazy looking these giant hundreds of feet tall
      machines that looked like they were designed Dr. Seuss and left to became
      a very dangerous hazard. It looked like some kind of trippy art
      installation and it also had an ominous could be used for evil purposes
      type of feeling too. I watched the Distillers play. The day before we
      played with them and the drummmer Andy's dick drum pedal broke and Chad
      ran up like a stud and fixed it right there. That guy Andy is pretty
      funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night before somewhere else in Germany we played and at the end of the
      set a musician/composer Eckhart Ellers who makes great records came on
      stage with us for the encore and rocked his laptop and it was a trip we
      jammed out and I played trumpet and it was fun. I played trumpet on stage
      last night too, I am really enjoying playing trumpet alot lately. I plan
      on playing it with the band whenever I get the chance now just rocking it
      whenever I can. I wanna be real with it I know I can never have great
      technique like Lee Morgan but I can be as beautiful as I can. It is my
      every intention to keep practicing and get somewhere.

      morning. Did yoga listening to this cool record I found by Eddie
      Henderson, a cool trumpet player. Made in '73 has Herbie Hancock, Lenny
      White, Bennie Maupin, and Buster Williams on bass. I think it is the same
      Buster Williams who played in the new Wave band 'The Escalators' and then
      in the Gang of Four when I first saw them play at Perkin's Palace. That's
      a trip because this is a space out fusion record similar to 'Bitches Brew'
      or 'Killes de Filimanjaro'. I think that's how you spell it those are both
      Miles Davis electric albums.

    <p>
      there's a guy called Patrick Gleeson playing arp and moog synthesizer on
      this shit too, it is dope.

      Well, I ate japanese food with nice people the day before yesterday. I
      also watched a movie called 'High Society that had Bing Crosby, Frank
      Sinatra, Grace Kelly and Louis Armstrong in it. I liked it alot. I love
      Louis Armstrong of course and I would have liked to a more trumpet playing
      but that's o.k. Bing Crosby is the suavest man that ever lived. The next
      day I went to Stuttgart in Germany and rocked a gig. I haven't played hard
      like that for a while and haven't been jumping around a lot lately and now
      my fingers hurt and the back of my neck is very sore. It will pass soon.
      The neck thing is a condition that Greg Hetson named 'Gig Neck'. When I
      played in the Circle Jerks and Greg was the guitar player we played a show
      and we were both head banging like crazy (I didn't know it was called head
      banging back then I thought it was just dancing) and the next day Greg
      said "Ouch I've got gig neck". Of you don't bang your head then you bang
      the fuck out of it then your neck will hurt for the first few gigs. I bet
      the guys in Slayer get gig neck I saw them once in '92 or so and they
      banged there heads exclusively. By exclusively I mean that they didn't
      move any other parts of their bodies just brutal head banging the whole
      time. Anyways, after the gig we flew back to London, but we had to rush
      off the stage into cars and drive really fast to Nuremberg where the
      airport was open and then we flew to London. It took along time all that
      driving and flying after the show and I think we were all ready for bed by
      then. When we drove to Nuremberg from Stuttgart the cars went super fast
      at one point 230 kilometers per hour and I didn't like it I was scared it
      seemed to fast and dangerous to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today I ate and played trumpet. I walked in the park for a couple of
      hours. It was nice at the park and I fed the ducks a muffin. Little baby
      fuzzy ducks too. There were lots of muslim women there who were wearing
      head to toe black material over their whole bodies so all you could see
      was there eyeballs. It was hot out too. I was wearing surf shorts and no
      shirt and a bald head. Some of the women let their faces be seen. It
      seemed so mysterious to me. I was very curious to talk to them because
      they just seem like they come from a completely different world but when I
      smiled at them they looked the other way. I guess I look pretty weird to
      them with a bunch of tattoos and stuff and no shirt. maybe one day I will
      get to know someone like that. If it was the 50's i would go live in
      Morocco like Paul Bowles and trip on the scene. Did anyone ever read the
      book by paul Bowles called 'The Spiders House'. It is a great book to
      learn about the muslim culture over there. Well, at least to someone like
      me who knows nothing it seemed like a good way to learn stuff. For all I
      know a muslim from North Africa might think The Spiders House is a bunch
      of hogwash nonsense. I loved that book though. It's a drag now that there
      is such a brutal divide between western and muslim cultures from
      mysterious exotic lands. It's probably not safe to go there now or
      something. Maybe it is safe and I am just a victim of propaganda. I really
      want to go to Africa, the whole place from top to bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was at home I saw the band 'Snake river Conspiracy', now I know you
      might think that I am not objective because i have been romantically
      involved with the singer for a year but I gotta tell you. The singer's
      name is Tobey Torres and she rocks like nobody;'s fucking business. She is
      the most intense screaming wildest animal you ever saw who is also sexy as
      hell and will rock your world. I have know her for a while now and had
      never seen her sing but when I saw it my jaw dropped and I couldn't
      believe it it was Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Tobey it was a part of her I had
      never seen she was a freak a freak I tell you she was out of control,
      wild, amazing. A true rocker. You gotta see it. It is a great thing to see
      ,and Jason Slater who makes all the music lays it down solid and heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well I like pizza. and Salvador Dali moustaches and rice with soy sauce
      and Pete De Frietas's drumming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that's how you spell his name he was the drummer in Echo and the
      Bunnymen I think he died in a bycycle accident. I met him when I was a kid
      and I saw Echo and the Bunnymen play at the Whiskey. I was on acid and was
      a kid and Echo Bunny men were the greatest thing I ever saw. But don't
      worry when the acid wore off I still loved them and I still love them they
      are great my favorite record is 'Heaven Up Here'.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I met Pete de Frietas I said "Tony Williams is my favorite drummer
      who is yours?". And he said, I don't really think about how good a drummer
      is just care how good he sounds in his band. That was a thing to say that
      made me think in a different way.He sure sounded great in the Bunnymen.
    </p>

      So, here we are on tour again. Just pulled into London, England. I am
      tired. But not too tired to go and see Patti Smith and her band tonight.
      We were driving in from the airport and it seemed like a cool part of town
      I saw this cool looking rasta guy and he was with a hot looking girl and
      he looked like he walked of the back cover of Catch a Fire and she was
      wearing a short skirt and beautiful long ebony legs. Then I saw a cool
      looking old fat lady who looked like she was of Eastern European heritage
      , like she could make a mean borscht and dumplings or something I was
      thinking hey London ain't so bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyways I wrote that 1st paragraph a few hours ago, When I saw those
      people earlier I also saw through the car window that Patti Smith and her
      band were playing at a theatre there in Sheperd's Bush. I just came back
      from it. Man it was so beautiful amazing unbelievable. I cried about 5
      times. She was so powerful and so in touch with the truth and so caring
      and loving and vicious and cut through all the bullshit and crystallized
      the essence of what makes living worthwhile into a 2 hour rock show. plus
      she played clarinet. and some wicked guitar. I love her. Her band sounded
      great it was one of the great shows I have ever seen. Right up there with
      last time I saw her when she opened for Neil Young at the forum.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also saw a great show back in L.A. a few weeks ago, Squarepusher. He is
      the cutting edge of electric bass playing he blew minds, and rocked like a
      wild ass but sophisticated animal. A lot of the crazy sounds and
      percussion sounds that you here on his records are actually bass playing
      through effects. He is a great virtuoso and likes to party.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we were home we went into the rehearsal studio and then the
      recording studio. Our intention was to was to write and record 2 songs to
      put on our greatest hits record that's gonna come out in November. But
      instead we wrote and recorded 15 songs and they rock. We played a wide
      variety of music arranged into song format that is among the most diverse
      and dynamic good feeling shit we have ever done, at least that's how it
      feels to me. We gave it no thought we just rocked and it worked well, it
      is the fastest we have ever recorded so much material it was the way to go
      I can't wait for y'all to hear it. No thinking just rocking.
    </p>
    <p>I want to be like Patti Smith when I grow up.</p>
    <p>love to all</p>

      Penultimate means second to last. We just played the Penultimate gig of
      the second leg of the U.S. part of the Red Hot Chili Peppers By the Way
      World Tour. tomorrow night is the last night in Alberquerque. That is a
      crazy word, Alberquerque. Then we have 7 weeks of no gigs. we are gonna
      take 2 weeks off and then write and record 2 or 3 new songs for a greatest
      hits record to come out at a future date, before getting back on tour in
      August.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am listening to the Mars Volta right now. It makes me really miss them.
      I feel a deep melancholy about them not being with us on this last leg.
      God Bless Jeremy. I think their record is coming out any day now, I can't
      wait to get a copy of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last leg with Snoop has been a trip. A completely different energy
      than what we are used to. He fucking rocked the shit out of Denver
      tonight, he was really going for it. There was a deep groove on the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can't remember when I wrote the last flea mail i think it was
      Shreveport. New Orleans was fun I tried to go see George Porter play but
      he didn't really play he wasn't there. If I would have seen him I would
      have seen one of the funkiest bass players ever to pick up a bass. If
      anyone goes to buy a cd tomorrow make it a Meters c.d.. That's George
      Porter's band The Meters

    <p>Meters</p>

      Tonight backstage we were making a list of the 20 best guitar driven rock
      bands ever. It was hard to make the list because my favorite is not
      necessarily the best or the most important. I think my list was this
    </p>
    <p>Led Zeppelin</p>
    <p>The Jimi Hendrix Experience</p>
    <p>The Beatles</p>
    <p>The Clash</p>
    <p>The Who</p>
    <p>The Ramones</p>
    <p>Black Sabbath</p>
    <p>The Doors</p>
    <p>The Cure</p>
    <p>Iggy and the Stooges</p>
    <p>Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band</p>
    <p>Funkadelic</p>
    <p>Nirvana</p>
    <p>The Yardbirds</p>
    <p>Queen</p>
    <p>Neil Young and Crazy Horse</p>
    <p>The Rolling Stones</p>
    <p>The Velvet Underground</p>
    <p>Cream</p>
    <p>Joy Division</p>
    <p>
      John's list was the same as mine except for 4. He did not have The Cure,
      Joy Division, Neil Young and Crazy Horse, or Captain Beefheart and the
      Magic band and instead had
    </p>
    <p>The Sex Pistols</p>
    <p>The New York Dolls</p>
    <p>Fugazi</p>
    <p>Slade</p>
    <p>
      These lists are really not our favorites ever just the ones we think are
      best and have had the most impact and power on the shape of guitar driven
      rock music. I mean I listen to The Slits way more than I listen to the
      Rolling Stones, X way more than Queen, and so on but it's not about
      personal taste here.
    </p>
    <p>Anthony didn't make his list yet.</p>
    <p>I have a tattoo on my arm that says papaya. did I tell you that yet.</p>
    <p>?</p>
    <p>
      Blackie and James came to the gig tonight. They looked like they were
      having fun. John's mom Gail came too. She is a kind woman, I like her.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got fireworks in Texas and when we made the long drive from Oklahoma to
      Denver, Louis and Gage and I took a break from our Boggle tournament long
      enough to pull over and blow the fuck out of a KFC bucket and some old
      stale cookies. It was extremely fun a very high level of fun. We also set
      off some rockets that went far. We probably burnt down half of kansas but
      it was a gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      hey my music school The Silverlake Conservatory of Music is a really cool
      place a non profit organization with hundreds of students and lots of
      teachers being employed and everyone loves it but it loses a lot of money
      it needs money if anyone wants to donate some cash I would really
      appreciate it it costs me a lot to keep it going. Anyone could call the
      school and donate it is in Los Angeles.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am gonna go read 'Welcome to the Monkey House' by Kurt Vonnegut Jr. (one
      of my favorite humans) and go to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>Lots of love to all.</p>

      So i hope everyone knew I was joking about calling wynton marsalis a
      retard.....I saw him play when he was just a youngster with Art Blakey and
      the Jazz Messengers and my mind was completely blown, he was unbelievable.
      I guess i feel a little weird about making that joke because we are in New
      Orleans now the land of the Marsalis family....
    </p>
    <p>
      well maybe the joke was funny anyway I mean he is such a bespectacled
      intellectual anyways that he it makes the joke kind of funny, i mean he
      should of put Kenny Dorham in that damn thing anyway...I take it all bAck,

      Harrah's casino and hotel in Shreveport, Louisianna. Started off with a 8
      hour bus ride to get here. Continued tournament boggle with Louis and
      Gage. Posted quotes by Louis on the wall for inspiration the other day.
      Continued reading 'The Bonesetter's Daughter's Daughter' by AMy Tan. It
      definitely has some good parts but not a classic. Learning a bit about
      China but not as much as from Zhang Yimou. Slept watched t.v arrived in
      Shreveport. Watched 'About Schmidt', I like those kind of slow sad movies
      and this new breed of sad pathetic comedy that is in vogue. I ate fried
      catfish from room service. Then I went down to the casino saw Louis, Gage,
      Rose, and Anthony. We walked around I gambled and lost or won nothing. We
      went to the top of the riverboat and it smelled kind of weird like eggs
      but it was a nice warm breeze and we ambled about for a half hour and the
      captain gave us a tour of the controls. There were some real interesting
      people in the casino. One lady had some kind of cord attaching her to the
      slot machine. It looked like those thing that old people have to attach
      them to a tread mill if they fall over. It looked really crazy to me. Then
      I came back to my room.It has beige walls and beige patterned carpet and
      brownish curtains. Brownish beige bed. I read and went to sleep.

      I love Atlanta. I don't even know why. Whenever I am here I just get a
      good feeling it's not like anything particularly amazing has ever happened
      to me here or anything I just like it. I like the air, the beans and rice,
      the the easy way that people are with each other. We had a good show
      tonight I think, well I think they all have been good. I really dug Snoop
      tonight, he and his group just seemed deep in the groove it was cool. He
      has so many great songs to play. I have been playing my trumpet a lot
      lately. I get so much joy out of it. The feeling of the metal against my
      lips the buzzing in my head, reaching for the deepest tone, finding my way
      around the chords I love it. I need to polish it up it is a little murky
      looking, it is such a nice silver plated Callichio trumpet. Today I played
      'Donna Lee' and 'Au Privave' and 'In a Sentimental mood'. Did anybody ever
      see that jazz documentary by Ken Burns that was on t.v. in America a
      couple of years ago? Well, it was pretty cool except they never showed
      more than 10 seconds of Charlie Parker playing a solo and then they put 5
      straight minutes of Cassandra Wilson at the end....No offense to
      Cassandra, but give me a fucking break. They also spent way too little
      time on Charles MIngus who is, along with Duke Ellington one of the most
      important composers in jazz let alone the best upright bass player of all
      time. But the whole reason I got on this tirade is that my friend Tree
      pointed out to me the most ridiculous thing of all..............
    </p>
    <p>WHAT ABOUT KENNY DORHAM!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>
      One of the greatest trumpet players ever and they leave him out, not a
      measley mention...Is Wynton Marsalis retarded or what??? It seemed like he
      was in on consulting the whole thing .
    </p>
    <p>
      Shit, Kenny Dorham is a jazz great, a composer, a virtuoso, man, 'Una Mas'
      was my wedding song.........
    </p>
    <p>Anyway, there you have it.</p>
    <p>
      I still liked the documentary because there was lots of great stuff and
      great props for Louis Armstrong and I just love anything about great jazz
      that I can find.
    </p>
    <p>Not enough Coltrane either.......</p>
    <p>
      Well tomorrow we drive for ten hours to somewhere, I don't even no where.
    </p>
    <p>Kenny Dorham!</p>

      Last night we played in Charlotte, North Carolina. We were playing our
      hearts out and as soon as we got off stage Louis told us that someone was
      killed during the show. Somehow someone was electrocuted to death while
      were playing. I don't know who it was or what went wrong but the guy went
      to have fun at a concert and never came home. Bless his heart. Whoever it
      is he has been let in on the big secret. He is probably having a great
      time right now. My heart and my prayers go out to the person's loved ones.

      8 hour bus ride today. started in Orlando though and went to the Universal
      amusement park . The Spider man ride was really fun. It was a trip when
      spiderman jumped up and pointed right at me. The juraasic park ride was a
      little lame though it had a great drop at the end and me and John and Ak
      and sat hari got a really good picture of us flying down it. Then we went
      on a scary roller coaster and it was raining and we were flying upside
      down and stuff. Usually I am really scared of rollercoasters I don;t trust
      them and kind of have an irrational fear but I was o.k. but the rain hurt
      my eyeballs. Then we got on the bus and i stayed in my underwear all day
      and played boggle with Louis and Gage. We stopped at a truckstop and i
      went in there in my underwear and they were not pleased with me at all. We
      watched the Kurosawa movie 'Throne of Blood'. It was so great. Toshiro is
      unbelievable. The woman are portrayed in such a fucked up light though.
      They are either groveling crying spineless wisps or manipulative evil
      witches. I'm not sure if that is just a product of japanese culture or
      Kurosawa's personal feel. Now I am in Charlotte North Carolina. Anton
      Corbin was hangin out with us for a few days taking pictures. He is a very
      nice man. There is no one else I would rather have hanging out taking
      pictures of us. It was for Rolling Stone magazine I guess there will be
      some variety of pictures of us in there sometime soon. If you look closely
      at me you will see I have not trimmed my nose hairs in some time.

      sitting here in florida and a breeze is blowing and it comes from the
      ocean and a breeze does not always blow good things around a breeze can be
      full of tragedy too, full of anything but aahaaa with the tragedy comes
      the rebirth and the understanding and the peace and the love and the
      deeper life. the little bunny rabbits where I live are brown and they have
      little white tails. I like 'em alot but I didn't like the one that bit me
      when I tried to take it out of it's cage when i worked at the animal
      hospital. I worked at the animal hospital for the along time, the Miller
      Animal hospital, it was the last job I had before I made enough money
      playing music to support myself. The Dr. that worked there who was the
      head cheese, Dr. Miller was a very kind man with an amazing touch with
      animals. He could approach a totally vicious insanely pissed off dog or
      cat and put his hands on it and it would totally calm down it was amazing.
      He had a huge nose. Once he was standing around the corner and I could see
      his nose sticking out a couple of inches but no other part of his body. He
      ran a good hospital. Unfortunately I used to rip him off when I worked at
      the front desk because I wanted money for drugs, I would sell stuff then
      not write it down and pocket the money to go buy a half gram of coke or
      whatever. It was a shitty thing for me to do, I was really being an
      asshole, luckily he was still around later and I was able to apologize and
      payback for what it was worth. If you have done something you are not
      proud of, apologizing really helps get over it and move to being a cooler
      kinda cat. I first worked at the front desk there but after I showed up
      blazed on acid and speed a few times they put me in the back and had me
      clean out cages and stuff. I liked that because I was lazy and I would
      hide out and play with kittens and puppies. I love kittens and puppies. I
      love playing with them. It took me a while to understand the value of hard
      work and discipline.

      Yesterday I segwayed over to the St. Louis Arc and it was raining and I
      was wet and cold but it was very pretty and I looked up at the arch in the
      rain and cloud filled sky and it was pretty incredible. This giant fucking
      thing arching way up into the sky. That is some architecture put to good
      use. I mean not as good as providing shelter for homeless people that fall
      through the cracks but damn good good for something bitchin' to look at.

      I have started practicing my trumpet again. It feels food, it has only
      been about 4 days but my tone is starting to come back and yesterday I
      played 'Gertrude's Bounce' by ritchie Powell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ritchie Powell's wife was driving the car when it crashed and her and
      Ritchie and Clifford Brown all died. When I was a youngster all I wanted
      was to be like CLifford Brown when I grew up. Clifford Brown was my idol.
      HIs great recordings that made with Max Roach, man they are something
      else. 'Jordu' 'Cherokee' man the trumpet solos on those records are so
      beautiful. Clifford was a stand up musician. What a beautiful guy.
      Everyone deserves to hear Clifford Brown before they die. He spread the
      love.

      Hi everyone my computer is finally working again well not really but this
      new one is. This tour has been great. It has been amazing the amount of
      people coming out to see us everywhere. People we really respect alot have
      been coming to see us too, I mean artists we admire and that is exciting
      for us. We are just on auto pilot, on the move just rocking and eating and
      sleeping and traveling the occasional movies watching and book reading and
      casual stroll around the town. I was embarrassed by some dumb shit I said
      In Manchester which I will not repeat and which I have already forgiven
      myself for but besides that for me anyways it has just been good music
      playing. John and I and Omar from the Mars Volta have been jamming in
      hotel rooms and playing some crazy ass music. The Mars Volta has been just
      amazing. It is so inspiring to see them everynight. They are the best band
      we have ever played with without a doubt they are scintillating. They are
      stunning, they blow me away. The songs are so beautiful the feeling so
      fresh and new and what I crave to hear. The sound of it fills me up with
      the desire to break through of these mortal surroundings and transcend
      into a cosmic rockfest.

      Today we got into Munich in the late afternoon and hung in the hotel for
      an hour or so. I had fried sole and potatoes and salad and watched the war
      on tv. then went and rocked.when I got back from the gig there were a lot
      of people waiting in front of the hotel to get autographs but I ignored
      them and went straight up to my room . I would have graciously signed all
      of their shit but they were not really chili pepper fans they were
      professional collectors and ebay dealer wheelers. The little files with
      the stacks of glossy 8 by 10's are a dead give away. I mean there is no
      way they could have got from the show to the hotel in that time anyway,
      they didn't give a shit about the jams just the collecting fever.

      have been thinking a lot about Sudan lately. I wish for peace and
      prosperity for all the people there. I wish for all the babies to be happy
      and well fed and loved and for noone to ever play any part in a
      kidnapping. There is a lot of oil there. compssion in Sudan compassion in

      I am here in Glasgow eating Glaswegian eggs and salmon. Just flew in. I
      just spoke to the lady at room service to ask her if there was any milk in
      my scrambled eggs because I don't drink milk and she said yes and fuck it
      I already ate half of them oh well I'll be fine and I should of told them
      I only remembered to say no butter and I am healthy as a horse anyways. I
      just came to Scotland after snowboarding for 3 days at Mammoth mountain in
      the majestic Sierra mountains rocking down the slopes the flotacious
      feeling all up in me on the steep mountain whiteness the beautiful trees.
      The sun was shining the snow was plentiful the fun was fucking huge!
    </p>
    <p>
      That sun is still shining inside me here in the Glasgow hotel room even
      with that fucking milk in me. Much to my happy surprise when I got up to
      the mountain I saw that Fishbone was doing a gig up there. Me and Lerone
      went to see 'em and they were rocking and they jammed 'Voyage to the Land
      of the Freeze Dried Godzilla Farts' with that funky ass bass line they
      sang so well I was so happy to see them and Norwood Fisher their great
      bass player and my pal and also their drummer John and I snowboarded the
      day away ha ha ha !!!!!!!!!!! Whaaaaaaa!!!! Whooooooo!!!!!

      I had an infected foot but I peed on it and it got better thanks to Sat

      called Swordfish and it looks like it will probably suck doesn't seem like
      my kind of thing but I am bored and that is all there is maybe I will get
      a good view of halleberrys ass. probably will. it won't hold a candle to

      sitting and staring talking on the phone about nothing typing about
      nothing drinking vittel. Fly undone stained t shirt and a weak report card
      in L.A. and overflowing toilets and possibility of mold and being suckered

      Kurt Vonnegut said thqt when the entire sane population of the United

      much impact as a bannana cream pie falling off a 3 foot stepladder or
      something to that effect. People like to feel a common cause and to hold
      hands in a big circle in the street and feel meaningful. I understand, I
      wanna hold hands too but I don't know what it does. I don't know what to
      do about anything as inconceivable to me as mass violent murdering, I pray
      for peace for everyone of you.

      Just got back from the gig in Dresden. It was a different kind of show. We
      started Zephyr at the wrong time because I was getting my finger taped and
      didn't come in and that is the one song we play with a drum machine so we
      stopped and it was a big fucked up mistake...oops oh well. Ha ha ha ah
      ahahahaha bibballe squick a ree bop pop. Then we went straight from the
      stage all sweaty into a car into a plane into a hotel and now I am in my
      room wishing I could see the all star game but they don't have it Germany.
      Tomorrow we play Berlin. Anthony's legs are really hurting him and John's
      finger is bleeding. We rock. Snoop Dogg is gonna play with us on the 2nd
      leg of our U.S. tour that is gonna be cool....SNOOP!!!! Snoop rocks I love
      Snoop he is my favorite rapper ever with the possible exception of Chuck
      D.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love the GZA too. And ODB. Ozone for the Brozone. Well I am now reading
      about being a guard at Sing Sing it is kind of depressing. Jail is
      depressing. You have to really be an amazing person to come out of there
      with your light glowing. People do it though, they come out really smart
      sometimes, look at Eldridge Cleaver.

      Hi I am in Berlin. It is cold and snowy and full of insane German history.
      The Russians really bombed the bejesus out of this place at the end of
      WW2.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is remarkable that it is a functioning healthy city right now. People
      can build as good as they can destroy, it just takes longer. Tomorrow we
      are playing in Dresden. Phew, that was another murderous bombing rampage.
      Kurt Vonnegut Jr. survived it. The bombing game goes on and on. I don't
      want to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have been touring our dicks off. Yesterday we woke up in Bologna and
      flew to Dortmund and rocked and then flew to Berlin to rest. We fly around
      on a silver and green plane. It has fish and rice and vegetables and tea
      on it. It has lots of seats and we have books and ipods and newspapers and
      we talk about music and basketball and books and politics and wars and
      naked bodies and various things.
    </p>
    <p>Anthony's legs hurt. He has shin splints.</p>
    <p>
      I read a nice book by Paul Auster called 'The Book of Illusions'. It is
      about doing beautiful things just to do them for the air, not for any
      reward and if that happens does the thing even exist? It was a great book.
      At least thats what I think it was about. I got a skeleton suit after I
      saw the film of the Who rocking out at the Isle of Wight. It is fun but a
      little too hot. I also got some fuzzy yellow underwear but they are silly
      and a guy has to be in the right mood. Mostly I like my navy blue pants.
      We jam a lot on in the Chili Peppers. It is bad ass. I love it, we just
      make shit up in front of a lot of people and play it like we feel it. I
      love that....On our next tour we play with the great band 'The Mars Volta'
      I hope we jam some with them. Those guys really have have some jamming
      panache.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are playing now with The Toilet Boys. They are the nicest guys in the
      world and such a fun band. They are very handsome. I am listening to
      Charlie Mingus play the piano. I have a lot of growing to do as a
      musician. There are these guys who have such strong minds that they can go
      out in the snow naked with wet sheets on and sit in the snow and they see
      who can dry out the most sheets with their body heat throughout the course
      of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>They stay really healthy.</p>
    <p>Talk to y'all soon Flea</p>

      ended up being a really fun show. The people were really nice and fun and
      into it. They rocked. It was a total pleasure to play for them. There were
      all kinds of them.

      Thailand was amazing. As soon as i got there i felt such a warm inviting
      happy feeling. It reminded me of Costa Rica in that way. it was
      incredible. I really want to go back there and hang out for a long trip
      and swim and eat papayas and ogle the fine ass thai women. It is a trip to
      be going home right now after all this time away. L.A. seems like an alien
      place to me right now, I forgot what it is like. I'm sure I will remember
      right quick.

      Joe Strummer checked out. When we were driving to the Fuji festival in
      Japan a few months ago we got into this conversation about Joe Strummer.
      It went like most conversations we have ever had about Joe something like
      this:
    </p>
    <p>"Joe is the coolest guy with the most integrity"</p>
    <p>
      "Remember that time Joe went out of his way to make someone feel good who
      was obviously uncomfortable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How about when Joe was accosted by that fan who any other rock star in
      the world would have run from instantly but Joe gave him a hug and talked
      to him for 5 minutes because he was grateful that people cared about his
      music?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My favorite record is 'Sandinista', really you think 'London Calling'?"
    </p>
    <p>and so on.</p>
    <p>
      When we got to that festival all the bands were hanging out in the
      backstage area and it was fun but not Joe.....he was out camping with the
      people by a river whooping it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't know him that well but hung out with him a few times through
      mutual friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I was hanging out in the studio when he was recording his record
      'Earthquake Weather' and my girlfriend Loesha (now my xwife) was with me
      and she was just 17 years old and had come down from Canada and was shy
      and culture shocked. She sat there fidgeting and drew a picture on a piece
      of paper of a cat. Joe grabbed it and Thumbtacked it up on the wall saying
      "This is gonna make us play great!"......just to make her feel good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last time I saw him was at a rock show in L.A. and he hugged me and kissed
      me. I went home feeling great. He was a walking bundle of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Clash are my favorite band. They never stopped growing and changing.
      Their music means so much to me. It makes me feel so good when I hear it.
      The sound of it. I know it is supposed to be political but that's not what
      it seems like to me. To me it is purely humanitarian, it is all love. To
      me Politics means playing games to get what you want. Joe sang about
      people he didn't think were getting a fair shake, it is obvious that he
      cared deeply about them.
    </p>
    <p>I love him. If anyone was ever my role model it is him.</p>
    <p>The world has lost one of it's best humans.</p>
    <p>
      When he played at the Troubador before he walked off the stage he said
      "It's a sad and beautiful world! Goodnight!"

      Well Singapore. If we play with our shirts off tonight we will be arrested
      instantly and the show stopped. hmmmmm. If we remove any article of
      clothing at all the show will be stopped. ....Lately I have been
      performing in a pair of little underwear and bright orange socks shoes and
      hat. They recently passed a law here where people are now allow to wear
      undershirts (wifebeaters, singlets) in public. It would seem that they are
      really hurting in the personal freedoms department here. If someone is
      caught here with 20 grams of weed it is automatic death by hanging. DEATH
      BY HANGING!!! For a little bag of weed! shit. fuck. They must not get a
      lot of reggae shows around here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I probably have 20 grams of weed still floating around in my blood stream
      left over from my pot smoking days.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a strange place. I have not yet been outside, but the guy that
      picked us up at the airport yesterday had flashing disco lights in his car
      and little ornaments plastered all over the dasboard and driver's
      compartment of the car..pix of Mother Theresa, a big model of a mercedes
      benz race car, lots of crosses, and other crazy doo dads. The windows of
      the car were locked, it is illegal for them to unocked unless one has bars
      on the window. They don't want anyone falling out.
    </p>
    <p>These are some paranoid folks.</p>
    <p>
      Well, this is a lot different than what I am used to. Tonight, we will do
      our damnest to bring them the rock. To get their Singaporian bootys
      shaking.

      Up in the Hyatt hotel in Perth room # 940. I am leaving in 45 minutes to
      go to Singapore. I have been on tour for about 6 or seven weeks on this
      leg...I am ready to go home. I don't like to be away from home for this
      long. It is too long. I miss my daughter. Anyways it has been a great tour
      I'll stop whining now. I feel great, we have been playing great, I just
      miss my kid. I went surfing with the QUIRK BOYS yesterday at Rotnest
      island. It was a lot of fun, paddling and paddling and getting lefts and
      rights yeeeeah. Dane Quirk is a way better surfer than me though. At the
      end of the session we were about to boat on back to Freemantle and the
      boat caught on fire !!.. Shit, it was scary we could have been blown to
      bits. Luckily we weren't, and I lived to rock Perth last night like a
      maniac. It was fun they were an awesome crowd. I fucked the solo section
      of Californication though. It was the last night of playing with Quirk,
      they were great to play with, a sincere and rockin band with a great
      future ahead of them. I was just listening to the Laker game on my
      computer, they were down by 30 in the 3rd to the Mavs aand came back to
      win!!Kobe had a 21 point 4th. YYYYEEEEAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!! Now I am eating
      olives and snapper and rice and broccoli and green beans and onions and
      cauliflower. On the way to Singapore never been there before. The other
      night John and Chris and I (The G.F.C.) watched the movie 'Road to
      Singapore' with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. YUM I LOVE BLACK OLIVES.

      So I know I haven't written a fleamail on this whole tour of Japan, New
      Zeland, Australia and Southeast Asia but it believe it or not the time has
      just not presented itself. I had to write liner notes for the early
      records of ours that they are reissuing and between that and my personal
      emailing (not that this isn't personal, it is) and my life, I just
      couldn't get i together. But Here I am. Japan was a fucking trip like
      always. We played some great shows there, except for the first one in
      Tokyo where, at least for me I was just too out of it and jet lagged to be
      great. I was mushy brained and playing wrong notes. Besides that we were
      rockin like crazy. There was a guy there in the front row at most of the
      shows who had a tattoo of me on his shoulder. That was really something to
      see. He seemed like a real cool guy too, he had a gentle happy energy when
      I met him at the train station. I met a girl before I left on this tour
      that had an autograph I gave her tattooed on the back of her neck. At
      first the whole thing made me kind of nervous but after a little
      reflection it made me feel really great. It made me feel like those people
      really believe in what I am, what my band is doing, that all the work that
      we do, all the humility, focus and opening up to the forces of the
      universe means something to people beyond a consumer/creator,seller
      relationship. I believe what we are doing is a spiritual exercise and
      people are feeling it. Life is a spiritual exercise! Always stay in the
      moment! Feel it! Shit, I gotta go get o a plane will write soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I aM sitting in the Sydney Airport restaurant listening to Bob Marley
      on my ipod and having a cup of chamomile tea waiting for my plane to
      Melbourne. I have a little cold I think, just a little snotty and droopy
      and tuckered out. This Bob Marley will make me feel great though and this
      nice tea that they made me at the airport. I'll fly into Melbourne and get
      a nice cozy sleep. I'll cuddle up in my pillows and think about the people
      that I love. So anyways.........We traveled around Japan and played. It is
      the most different place in the world to play that we have played at that
      is for sure. I don't even know why it is it just is. I feel like I am on
      another planet when I am there. We went to see the Sumo match in Fukuoka
      and that was dope. I love Sumo. I think I might have been a yokozuna in
      another life. I even bought a ceramic statue of a big fat Sumo guy fixin
      to kick some ass. We ate up some deeelicious greez there but I got a
      little tired of tofu balls and sushi by the end. Fukuoka was my favorite
      place that I went to there. The big cities are cool and wild and all but
      it is the rural Japan that I really want to see and the part I like the
      most. Not that Fukuoka is rural but it was as close as I got. It was more
      mellow and less worried about fashion and whatnot. I was planning on going
      and spending some days at a spa bathhouse type of thing out in the country
      traditional style but I was told that my tattoos might be a problem and we
      wouldn't be able to chill so I did not go. Maybe next time. I know that
      Kurosawa used to go to those places to write his scripts.

      It was brought to my attention that some people thought that I did not
      like Sau Paulo or that I insulted Sau Paulo. I just said the air was dirty
      and polluted. It is, was. I come from Hollywood, California . The air is
      dirty there too. I grew up in dirty air, it makes me feel at home. That
      doesn't mean I like it. I don't like it. I prefer to breathe clean air. I
      love Sau Paulo the people there are and were beautiful when we were there.
      I don't put a lot of thought in to these Flea mails, I just type 'em and
      press send on the computer. I had a great time in Sau Paulo it is a great
      metropolis. I just prefer the nature life. I am a nature boy. Just walked
      in the park in Porto Alegre. I tried to climb on a big blow up slide at
      the kiddie park but a man came up and yelled at me in Portugese, I thought
      he was gonna hit me, so I left. Before that I ate with my pals at a nice
      Italian Restaurant and the owner was a nice little man who was old and we
      took pictures with him. Stella said she wanted to pick him up.

      Just got back to the hotel from playing in Porto Alegre. The crowd was

      Now I am back in my hotel room listening to George Harrison sing 'Isn't it

      all the way through now. It is a very complicated piece of music. We are
      still a little awkward in parts but soon we will rock it live. Captain
      Beefheart! Man, that band worked so hard to play those incredible
      compositions. Everyone should pay more attention to it. Trout Mask

      We have one more show then we go home. Buenos Aires on my birthday. I will

      We are in the airport in Chile on the way to Brazil. Anthony said 'I'm
      starvulating" Chad offered me a gas mask. Louis said "sign these things
      for the record co." John said "did u play through peon last night?" Sat
      Hari said "Got about 2 and a half or three hours last night" I said
      "tomorrow we paddle out in Rio". So we played last night in Chile. I don't
      think we played as great as is possible we didn't really catch fire into
      an out of control blaze. But we played well. The crowd was great I would
      like to say Ola Nicholas!
    </p>
    <p>
      y Ola Valentina. Valentina is very cute. And all the rest of the fans we
      met who were so nice and friendly and welcoming. It was such a pleasure to
      meet them all after the show, they were kind people. Like Ingrid.
    </p>
    <p>
      People really love to get autographs. I wonder if they just lose them. A
      woman just walked by with a baby in a backpack. She was very pretty. I
      smiled at her but she gave me the stone face. Why is it that spme people
      will do anything to get near me and want my autograph and my picture and
      tell me that I am the greatest and the pretty lady walking by won't even
      smile at me in reciprocation?
    </p>
    <p>
      They have Dunkin Doughnits in Chile in the airport. Gage is greezing them
      up. I asked him if he was concerned about his colon he said he comes from
      a family, a long line of great crappers. People are asking for more
      pictures and autographs, they
    </p>
    <p>don't know I am writing a fleamail. Chad farted, it stinks terribly.</p>
    <p>
      I slept a lot in Chile. That's nice. I had a dream last night that I was
      holding hands with Serena Williams. We are going now to get on a giant
      metal tube which will surge us through the air to Rio. I know a little boy
      named Rio that lives in Costa Rica. He is incredible. He has a brother
      called Sogyal who is incredible too.

      Ahhhh a new day. Sun is shining on the sweet faces of the Chileans who
      like to kiss in public. Friends are there for all. Captain Beefheart is
      incredible every rhythm a new surprise around every corner a new and
      exciting feeling new colors and I wish that I can write that well one day.
      'Peon' on the 'Lick My Decals Off' album how beautiful is that. A fresh
      lovely day in Santiago what more could a man ask for? Watermelon and Abbey
      Road and anticipation of slow deep breathing yoga and the fourstrings Ha
      HA HAHAHAHAHAHA!!Hot damn. Haven't been outside all day yesterday which is
      kind of weird but I think I needed a good day opf rest I was pretty burnt
      out. Last time we played in Chile I ripped a ligament in my left leg
      really bad right before we went on, phew dohn't want that to happen again.
      Ready to rock these motherfuckers tonight. Thinking of Saskia Brown a
      little bit I hope she is happy. Sometimes I wish I had time to teach at my
      music school , oh well there will be a time for that. For now I will just
      keep teaching myself.

      Dear Everybody I am in Santiago , Chile. I just got into my room from the
      airport.
    </p>
    <p>I really lost it and snapped at the airport.</p>
    <p>I apologize for that.</p>
    <p>
      This is a message for the Chileans fans who met us at the airport. First
      of all, I am sorry about screaming at you at the airport, I really fucking
      lost my temper. I hardly slept last night, have not eaten a decent meal
      all day and just got off a 7 hour flight from playing last night in
      Venezuela. I just wasn't ready for being mobbed like that. I am very
      grateful to all of you that you care so much about our music that you come
      to meet us it is an amazing thing and it means the world to me that we can
      connect with you in the way that we do. But expressing your love that way
      by jumping on us and having no respect whatsoever for our space or our
      sanity does not work. There has got to be a better way. Fuck I don't know
      shit but I know that I felt attacked today. Granted I was tired and kind
      of in a shitty mood (Hey whattaya know? I'm not perfect!) and could have
      dealt with it more graciously but I really felt like the people who met us
      there didn't really give a fuck about us. I know that you see us on tv and
      that you listen to our c.d.'s., but we are just guys who are trying to be
      good at what we do and to bring you the best music that we can. We are not
      bigger than life. To tell you the truth today at the airport it was kind
      of scary.....I was scared. Walking off a plane delirious and hungry just
      wana go to my room and get a little peace and be focused and at my best to
      play here in Santiago and I walk out of an airport hallway and Listening
      to Fela really loud in my ear phones and basically just spacing out and
      all of a sudden there is just this giant crowd of people jumping all over
      me, the music was blaring in my ears I could see noo way out I didn;t know
      what the fuck was going on. I didn't know which way was up. I freaked.
    </p>
    <p>Anyway that's that.</p>
    <p>
      We played the last few days in Caracas, Panama City, and Costa Rica.
      Anthony, I, and John went to the beach in Costa Rica and it was so
      beautiful and muy tranquilo. I surfed my head off the whole time I was
      there it was awesome. The shows have been incredible the crowds have been
      the best ever in all 3 of those places. I hole a special place in my heart
      for Costa Rica I must say. We walked around in the old part of panama City
      and it was gorgeous. It was like walking in the center of a giant art
      piece. Old buildings painted in fading pastel colors, really nice people ,
      amazing. We went in an old maonastery that was abandoned in the 1700's
      there was a heavy peaceful feelingin there. I figure it was from years of
      people praying and meditating in there. Intense energy.
    </p>
    <p>Love to all,</p>
    <p>yours in fragility,</p>
    <p>Flea</p>

      Just got back to the hotel after the Giggy wig. Listening to Lee Perry.
      Got this ipod thing going on with lots of jams i dig it. Anthony and John
      got 'em too. Anthony got his for free. The gig was cool the people were
      fucking incredible, the Mexican people came to have a good time they were
      not fucking around, no pretense. When I was a kid my best friend for a
      while was Jose Santiago from Gudalajara. He is a great guy he was a great
      friend I always looked up to him. Mexico is such a nice country I love the
      feeling here, I feel like everyone knows something that I don't, like they
      are tapped into some kind of spirit world that a white motherfucker like
      me could never understand..... The opening band tonight was Pito Perez.
      They were cool people, I talked to them after the show they were so nice,
      they made me feel comfortable. There was a girl hanging out with them
      called Jeanette Jeanine too and she had beautiful energy all around her.
      Anthony told me that people get kidnapped around here. so this guy called
      Gage who works for us said the best thing to do is to come out swinging if
      some tries to kidnap me. I don't think I am good kidnapping target though
      but in any event if anyone tries I will bust some king fu on their ass.
      Unless of course it Jeanette Jeanine who tries to kidnap me.

    <p>Dear Everyvbody,</p>
    <p>
      It is so nice to write you again. I am here in Guadalajara, Mexico. I woke
      up today in Malibu, California where I live. Ahhhh, I love it there. We
      have had a month off to do whatever we wanted to do. I chose to stay home
      and surf like crazy constantly, hang out with my lovely daughter, and play
      with my friends. I had a great month. Since I have moved away from
      Hollywood, which I was really scared to do considering I had been living
      there for 30 years, this was the first time I have really been able to
      settle in to my new place. I don't think I have ever been happier. I feel
      relaxed and strong and like everything is working right inside of me. I
      just love the ocean, I wanna get in it and roll all around, be flung
      upside down and inside out with no choice in the matter. I am no longer
      the shittiest surfer out there everytime I go out, I am getting to the
      lower part of the average scale. I aM GETTING BETTER! I fucking love it. I
      wanna eat fish tacos after I get out of the water and waffles and eggs and
      rinse off my wetsuit and take a hot shower...Ha ha!!!....So anyway We
      boarded a plane today to come to Mexico and start our South American,
      Central American, Mexican tour. It is nice to be on tour again, even
      though I will miss my beloved home. I am ready to rock tomorrow night. I
      just wanna feel the electricity and power surging through me, be inside
      the groove, listening as hard as I can, giving to John, AK and Chaadley
      with all I have. I wanna see the faces, the bodies, the sweaty people. i
      wanna make someone laugh. I want to fantasize about the amazing asses that
      I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      John has been working on a solo record while we were off, Chad played
      drums on it. From what I heard it is incredible. John works constantly
      with much dedication and care. It will be great.
    </p>
    <p>I love you</p>
    <p>your lazy surfing friend,</p>

      Just got into Hawaii from Japan and Korea. The Korean show was really fun
      and we played with jane's Addiction. They were beautiful, they are really
      evolving into a new kind of band and making a new record that makes me
      happy, Steven Perkins is sucha great drummer he was rolling some big waves
      of drum beats. There was a Korean waitress in the airport who I probably
      would have married on the spot. I'd be eating kimchi for the rest of my
      days. Then we went to Japan and it was such a special night for me. It was
      so great to see all the people I love who were there....Jane's Addiction
      fellas, Gibby and Paul from the Butthole Surfers, George Clinton, and I
      met the guy from Spiritualized whose band I really like. We had a really
      fun show and at the end George CLinton came up and rocked with us on Give
      it Away he was so awesome, just a big booming soul feeling the spirits and
      letting the spirits feel him. He spoke with John about doo wop for a long
      time in the dressing room and John really liked that. George CLinton is
      such an important part of my life and development of my art. Joe Strummer
      was there somewhere too, but I didn't see him but his beautiful wife and
      daughter watched our show. I was just so happy that all these people that
      I know are still out there and rocking and being all together on a
      mountain in Japan after al these years. After I watched 'Westway to the
      World' a dvd about the Clash and it made me cry when Joe Strummer said
      'You don't fuck with a band". Well now I am in Hawaii and we have the day
      off tomorrw maybe I will go surfing if I am not too lazy and maybe even
      jump off the baboons nose if I am a raw and rollicking stud.

      the thick delirium of jet lag is weighing me down the invisible heavy
      cloud seeping into my pores and pushing me down into the floor of my
      Korean hotel room. Ali Farka Toure is just rocking the stale air into a
      state of vibrant feelings though. I saw a show on the black faced
      spoonbill birds that live on a Korean island somewhere they are very
      pretty and are facing extinction. When it is very cold they tuck there
      faces into their feathers and crouch down low standing on one leg to
      minimize skin exposure to the cold. Sometimes that is what I have to do on
      tour, just go rock like crazy and then crouch down low on one leg for a
      bit in my room to minimize exposure to the world. And when I go home I GO
      SURFING!!. Oh surfing is fun. I really suck at it but I am getting a
      little better, learning to cut back into the wave and I dream of being
      able to surf big Indonesian waves one day..that is my goal. I think it is
      realistic.

      It has been bought to my attention that summer is upon us in the northern
      hemisphere and that we should get naked and hurl our bodies into bodies of
      water and frolic about without a care in the world when we have the least
      opportunity. We should eat watermelon at a feverish pitch and smear it all
      over ourselves if we feel like it. We should subtly ogle members of the
      opposite sex in their bathing suits and appreciate the great god given
      gifts. We should have dirty feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here in L.A. went surfing this morning with a nice man and ate ommellettes
      with extra letters in them. El grupo is enjoying a week or so off before
      we head to Korea, Japan, and Hawaii next week. It should be fun. Once
      again we strike deep into the heart of virgin territory when we play in
      Seoul, Korea I think I will be tall over there. Are they short in Korea? I
      have never seen a Korean basketball player, but they made a damn good
      showing in the world cup. By the way, lets not forget how great the world
      cup was, I would like to wholeheartedly congratulate Brazil on their
      victory, I will will be wearing my Brazil shirt proudly, in honor of
      Ronaldo and Rivaldo and their ilk but also in honor of all the stupendous
      sets of female buttocks in that mystical and magical land of bubblebutts.
      Anyways, back to Korea...I like Korean bbq and kim chi and I used to see
      this Korean energy healer guy who waved golf clubs at me and said he had
      to open the window because he was detoxing a terrible stink out of my soul
      and he could not breathe. I think he might have been putting me on but i
      am not sure.............

      I am off to the studio to listen to a mix of 'Someone' a song that will be
      one of the b sides on our next single 'The Zephyr Song'.

      Okay so this is the start of the new fleamail fresh for 2002 suckas!!! I
      am in Denmark right now, we just played the Roskilde festival it was
      raining and cold and I wore a sweater and a hat for the whole show. Slater
      played too, I don't know those guys and I didn't get to know 'em I just
      know they are from California like us but I think the similarities end
      there besides that we both have 2 legs and arms and guitars n\ and stuff.
      We played pretty good tonight, I don;t know if we really caught fire like
      an out of control blaze but it was still pretty good. We played the opther
      night in London and and I thought we were smokin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been a long time since I have written but I am getting back into
      the swing Right Now! I guess y'all know we made a new record, it is coming
      out real soon. We worked hard on it and are proud of it we think we are
      puttingsomething worthwhile out into the world . The last months have been
      full of us working our dicks off doing lots of press and takikng pictures
      and making videos and to tell you the truth it was driving me fucking
      crazy. If you ever sit in a room 9 hours a day and talk about yourself,
      you'll know what I mean......When we finished with that we started
      seriously getting into playing some gigs and that has been great. I feel
      so good about going deep inside myself to play these days, like if I can
      just go to this beautiful place inside me where god is then I don't even
      have to do anything the music just comes flowing out and moving my body
      all over the place. I love it. We are getting along great and music is
      fun.

    <p>JOhn Entwistle died yesterday.</p>

      Besides that I am just warming up this writing thing, I will be smarter
      later. I have been reading about Rasputin. And Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro
      Mifune. We have been out for 6b weeks we are going home on Sunday. I miss
      my dogs. Clara has been with me and that has been great.

      Going sunset mexican beach mexican kids and dad with fishing string. A
      cool breeze and a dog a grey dog so beautiful. I can let go of this tired
      body this thick head that replays and replays it's anguish. All the sand
      on the muthafuckin beach all the orange clouds in the sky in my eye. I
      love the sound of the spanish language when it's faint murmurs float
      across the beach blowin around. The aerodynamics a zillion world famous
      scientists could only dream of just a casual cruise for a mexican pelican
      and the human race's life and death played out every 3 seconds every wave
      that forms and crashes and I can give it up to all of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      and so the sun pokes through the golden orange glow through the barrel of
      cloud and the children wait anxiously for a fish wait for the mystery to
      unfold and the sun pops through even brighter and the father's proud
      sillouhette stands like a real man.

      so the sun is setting the end of it any way, 33 shades of blue in to dark
      orange and just brown and the longest straightest line of dark blue I have
      ever seen. The moon is about 3 quarters and i wonder what those white
      lines that shoot out of a couple of the craters like Chuck Biscuit's
      tattoo. Biscuits the great drummer from D.O.A. and Black Flag and the
      Circle jerks who blew my mind when i saw him play with the jerks in '81
      and saw what punk rock drums were for, anyways they shoot out and I look
      at 'em for a longtime through my big black telescope and saturn and
      Jupiter too, so fucking peaceful until a raccoon or something saunters by
      and my dogs bark bloodymurder oh I live in the mountains and I have a red
      beard and a sinus infection which has fucked me up for a month now and I
      refuse to take antibiotics. Cleansing for the new year, not some nice
      hippie juicy enemas cleanse but the bodyrocking violent kick your
      motherfucking emotional ass cleanse ahh yeah i can take it bring it on. I
      hope everyone had a nice xmas or whatever holiday gets you together with
      your loved ones, mine was nice lots of happy kids and cake eating dogs and
      I have a new girlfriend and she is kind and strong. If you don't care
      about xmas or whatever well then don't leave any milk and cookies out for
      Santa.

      We ended the touring and did a couple a shows some benefit shows one which
      was the Neil Young show to help out the Bridge school a school for
      Handicapped kids in the Northern California and it was so great the
      feeling was so fine everyone that was there performers and audience were
      feeling like they were a part of something that was important and that
      good feeling was all in the air nice and clear and strong I loved it. it
      was the first time we ever played acoustically and technically we didn't
      have it together at all it sounded weird and feeding back and shit but the
      spirit of it was super fine anyways. Neil Young was so awesome i really
      love him and his band of survivors are like a bunch of gnarly pirates that
      have seen a lot of notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another one was with pearl jam up in Seattle for local charities and Eddie
      Vedder had a Ralph Nader button on it looked nice. We are going to South
      America in couple for weeks to do Rio and Buenos Aires and then after that
      we will settle down and make a new record. John's solo record is coming
      out soon in Feb I think it is so amazing he is the best oh the best just
      so pure and cutting through everything else with digging deep vision and
      intense discipline after we do South America he is going to europe to
      promote it and do a few gigs on his own.
    </p>
    <p>happy new year</p>
    <p>love flea</p>

      oh and John and I and Josh Klinghoffer have joy Division cover band we
      played one show it was one the greatest show I was ever in and we have

      Hello. So I am in Portland, Oregon . Being in this place always reminds me
      of the month I spent here working on the film 'My Own Private Idaho' I had
      such a good time, it will always be a time in my life I remember of being
      part of something meaningful with a bunch of people I had just met. I
      think of the friendships I made that changed my life and discovering the
      dark and mysteriously seedy underbelly of this town of which I engaged
      completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gigs have been rockin lately though I can't help but notice that this
      tour is ending at the right time. We have just been working long enough to
      the point where it is time to stop time to get away from it and breathe a
      little bit time to get with dogs and children. The affection of children
      Is just something that means you are respected and that is a good feeling
      for anyone I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have been on a private plane lately and it has a gold sink and a nice
      stewardess who is friends with Jerome Kersey and I am hoping he will come
      to our show tomorrow night. Tomorrow night we are filming our show for a
      home video/dvd release. The night after that is Seattle and it is the last
      show of the whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last time I wrote a fleamail I mentioned something about wanting to
      have sex and people seemed to have responded to that in a strange way, I
      mean I hear things here and there about my fleamails but that came back to
      me a lot, everyone mentioning it to me with some weird angle about why I
      would write that. ......People are so obsessed with sex, it's only sex--
      it is good-- what's the big deal, I just wrote down a feeling I was having
      without thinking about it, relax it is fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is time for me to have some breakfast now, I just got up. Oatmeal.
      Bananas. water.

      Yesterday we played at the mtv video awards and it was a completely weird
      day like those things always are........ I think something is going on
      with me because in the last 2 days I have thrown 2 tantrums and that is
      not my usual style. The day before the tv shindig we were rehearsing and I
      got in an argument with Anthony and I threw my bass down on the ground and
      stormed off in a fury and then when were playing the song during the show
      itself I once again hurled my bass to the ground and chucked a tanty, or
      as the english say threw a wobbly. Of course Anthony and I talked it out
      and lovingly made up and I felt silly for losing control like that, but I
      guess I am just feeling the anger lately. Maybe I need to have some good
      healthy sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday we arrived at the mtv joint in the early afternoon and rehearsed
      and it went fine considering that we had to edit our song down from it's
      normal length to conform to their time restrictions and we didn't have our
      projection thing together as we were gonna do it for the show, but we
      worked it out at the last second and when our manager Cliff Burnstein left
      the rehearsal he said to us with all nurturing assurance "You guys have
      got it dicked" as he strolled out the door. So, feeling confident we
      waited about, John did yoga and Anthony and I fiddled about with what
      clothes to wear, I was confused between the white versace suit and the t
      shirt that said "look I'm on t.v" on the front and "fuck me I'm famous" on
      the back. I eventually settled for "blow me I'm famous" because I did not
      want someone to accidentally buttfuck me as I was on my way up to accept
      an award. The fuck me I'm famous thing was Anthony's idea that I
      appropriated and it was a fine idea indeed. I eventually decided to wear
      the suit for the red carpet press entry and the t shirt for the rest of
      the shenanigans. Now the red carpet entry this is something to behold.
      Anyone who has ever garnered a modicum of celebrity and done one of these
      red carpet entrys will have to agree that it is about the weirdest thing
      anyone can ever do in their life besides being hung from the ceiling
      upside down for 12 hours with a banana in your butt watching an
      everlasting loop of the egg lady scene from John Water's Pink Flamingoes..
      Ya walk into it and a zillion people all yell at you as loud as they can
      because they want you to talk to their tape recorder or camera or stand
      there and get your picture taken. It is a bright red carpet and lights are
      flashing like crazy and it goes on for about a football field or so and it
      is confusing and you get directed to a different person every 30 seconds
      or so until your head explodes or you pee your pants and you thought that
      before you got there you were really gonna spread good feelings into the
      world but now all you can do is yell back at them and not trip over
      Destiny's Child or Wyclef Jean as you blurt out another forced witticism
      on your way to the end. It is just so crazy looking and all the famous
      people act like it is the most normal thing in the world and it is very
      fucking weird. Then we went and sat in the audience because we up for an
      award which nsync won and also we sat through the opening monologue by the
      younger wayans brothers...... I looked about to look at famous people and
      I sat in front of Laurence Fishburne who is an incredible actor and I am
      proud of him. The person I wanted to talk to most of all was Dr. Dre
      because he is such a great music maker but I did not get to. Anyways
      enough of the name dropping and ass kissing. We then went back to our
      dressing room and got ready to play warmed up and whatnot and then went
      down to play and waited around while we were shoved to and fro by a sea of
      anxious celebrities then we went and played the song and everyone played
      well but my bass kept cutting out and I was very frustrated and it was
      completely silent for the whole last chorus and I threw the afore
      mentioned tanty at the end and screamed FUCK!!!!........FUCK!....... and
      it wasn't very nice of me but it worked out o.k. and the direct signal
      from my bass was heard so the bass did not completely disappear on tv just
      got softer. After all that we went out to some parties and I had matzoh
      ball soup late at night with some nice people and that was that. I still
      have not had that healthy sex i was talking about before................I
      have to say that as ridiculous as the whole event was and is it is great
      to know that it is symbolic of us connecting our music with a lot of
      people and I believe our music comes from a place of infinite and pure
      beauty and of that I am so thankful. Now I am on an American airlines
      flight to San Francisco where we play tomorrow night as we resume the last
      couple of weeks of our tour. I look forward to playing a nice long rockin'
      show tomorrow night and I love everyone.

      hello all. The body is an amazing thing you have to trust it and listen to
      it it is always talking to you. Mine talks to me alot and I don't always
      like what it says but I have to listen. Remember a few months ago I wrote
      a fleamail about the monk I met on the airplane who I talked to and he
      gave me red string to put around my neck? Well it turns out that he is
      staying about a block away from where I live. And then on top of that he
      was up in the mountains just where I am in the mountains and we hung out
      and went to eat together. It was a wild coincidence and I think sometimes
      things are just meant to be, but maybe it was his pal who helps him out
      who is the one I am supposed to meet, well anyway it is a trip. We
      meditated together and it was great. I don't smoke weed anymore but I
      really like the smell of it still. I saw a guy smoke as much weed as
      Smokey in 'Friday' the other day and I didn't smoke any but it smelled
      great and when we play gigs i always smell it and it smells great.
    </p>

      Oh when I was speaking of Caroline Myss the other day I forgot to mention
      that she has a website well worth checking out called

      I am up where the mountains meet the sea. They come crashing together the
      two majestic forces, they keep doing it for thousands of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was born with a heart of stone made to be broken with one hard blow
      I've seen the ocean crash on the shore come together with no harm done"
    </p>
    <p>
      That is a quote by Perry Farell from the great song 'Ocean Size' by Janes
      Addiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think of that when I look at this place where I am. It is bursting with
      life, so here I am to unwind my body and mind in this break before the
      last 3 week leg of all the touring for Californication. The last places we
      played before we just finished were Quebec City and Montreal. I felt like
      we played really well in Montreal, Quebec we did pretty well but it felt
      to me like we were really taking off in Montreal. I don't know if how I
      feel about a show has anything to do with the audience's perception
      though.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must tell all of you that we had an incredible experience in Quebec of
      another nature. A woman who I have the utmost respect and admiration for
      came out to host a z.com episode which will air soon. Her name is Caroline
      Myss. She is a teacher, a speaker, and a writer and has intuitive
      abilities which she has refined to a very high level. She is someone who
      has had a very profound effect on my life and the person that I am today.
      She teaches about many things it would be a disservice to her for me to go
      into her teachings in any detail but she teaches about spiritual energy
      which flows through all of us and how we can use it to serve ourselves and
      others in the highest possible way.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many books and tapes available of her thoughts, the first set of
      tapes I heard of hers are called 'Energy Anatomy' and they are pretty easy
      to find. They mean a lot to me and I gotta say that I was super fucking
      honored that she came out to share her ideas with us and she is the
      coolest.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is the big news lately as far as I am concerned. I am reading short
      stories by William Faulkner they are great. I love you all.

    <p>It is time for a new fleamail</p>
    <p>
      I am on our bus left N.Y., N.Y. about 5 hours ago enroute to Buffalo. I am
      reading 'The Little Sister' by Raymond Chandler. My city is Los Angeles
      and I love that city. Raymond Chandler might write about Los Angeles
      better than any other man but John Fante would give him a run for his
      money. These kind of mystery books use a different part of the brain that
      I don't think is ever used for any other purpose. So, to top it off John
      and I just watched 'The Big Sleep' which is based on a Chandler book and
      stars the studly man of macho integrity and quick wit Humphrey Bogart. I
      wonder how many men of that era took it upon themselves to be macho sexist
      assholes thinking they were approximating a little bit of Bogies suave
      hard nosed demeanor and left all of Bogies love by the wayside........ I
      am listening right now to 'Harvest' by Neil Young. I love Neil Young
      sometimes live I have been known to sing a quirky and cute version of 'The
      Needle and the Damage Done', the thing is I try to do it all poignant and
      soulful drawing on my deep well of dynamic life experience but it just
      comes out quirky and cute and out of tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      my microwave burrito is ready and Chuck is at the wheel. Chuck is the
      driver who drives John and I in a big ol' tourbus which had stereos and tv
      and a dvd player and nice beds. It is the greatest bus in the world. Chuck
      is the best driver I have ever seen. He takes great pride on getting us to
      where we are going safely and he has an open honest face. He helps us out
      in so many ways besides driving and it means a lot to John and I to be
      around his peaceful vibe when we cruise down the road. So, I rock my
      burrito in a cocoon of safety and candle light in my post Lauren Bacall
      splendor....... We have the greatest crew of any rock band in the world
      here they are:
    </p>
    <p>Drum Tech.. Chris Warren</p>
    <p>
      Chris has been my friend for a long time. When we were looking for
      drummers in the late 80's he came into audition and he didn't know how to
      play the drums very well at all. However, he accidentally left a cymbal
      behind and called me to arrange picking it up and we became pals. When
      Clara was just a chubby cheeked red afroed infant Chris was one of the
      only people who we could leave her with-- she was always totally relaxed
      and felt safe with him. He has since become a great drummer and now plays
      in the band 'The Bicycle Thief' who will be with us on the next leg of our
      tour. He has a tattoo of a totem pole of fat albert characters on his
      side. He has spectacular taste in music and is one of the nicest people I
      have ever met.
    </p>
    <p>Bass Tech.... Tracy</p>
    <p>
      Tracy is pretty new to us-- he has been with us on all of the
      Californication touring and he does a great job and doesn't get mad at me
      when I throw the occasional tantrum and I like him a lot but don't know
      him hardly at all.
    </p>
    <p>Guitar tech.... Dave Lee</p>
    <p>Dave Lee is</p>
    <p>
      Oh fuck it I am getting bored with this I will write about the rest of our
      crew later in short installments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things have been great lately. I have been doing Yoga with our super kind
      and slightly nervous new yoga teacher, I had a great session with him this
      morning and i feel relaxed and sprightly and all clean inside at least i
      did until I greased that pizza on the way out of N.Y. to put on top of my
      macrobiotic breakfast. The other night i woke up in the middle of the
      night doubled over in pain my tummy hurt so bad think it was from
      doughnuts but at least after i pooped I felt better not like when the same
      thing happened when I broke up with my girlfriend and it hurt so bad I
      checked myself into the hospital and they shot me up with diladud, I don't
      know if that was a good idea or not but it sure made my tummy feel better.
      When i arrived at the hospital they thought I might have some kind of
      exploding ulcer or something and I was all uptight asking them to put me
      in a backroom i didn't want to be recognized but after that diladud I just
      lay down on a stretcher in the middle of a busy hallway waving at everyone
      and chatting with anyone who had a minute thinking to myself "Ah now I
      know why all those people want to be junkies".............. Of course it
      wore off after a few hours and I dealt with all my shit and everyone knows
      that opiate use will stop you from ever growing in anyway at all and suck
      everything cool you ever had right out of your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well when we played last night I was trying to be funny yelling lots of
      ridiculous rock clichés into the mic like "how many people here are from
      Brooklyn!?!" and it was fun but nobody laughed. Well John laughed-- I saw
      him.
    </p>
    <p>I love playing bass alot.</p>

    <p>Hello everyone vote for Ralph Nader</p>
    <p>
      We are in Detroit in some ritzy suburb that seems to be nothing any kind
      of detroit that I have ever seen before. Last night I had a nice walk in
      the rain and lightning, the lightning was just blazing up the sky like a
      metallica album cover, huge forks piercing through the darkness making me
      feel part of the whole thing it was incredible. I was hoping to walk
      around out of my hotel and eat greek food and see interesting folks but it
      is nothing but wonder bread around here and I refuse to get in a cab and
      go anywhere so it's a fleamail and a little bass practice maybe some
      meditation and lazing around like a sloth. I don't feel like being real
      active today I'm gonna save it up for the giggy-wig tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
      We played the day before yesterday at some kinda beer festival in Latrobe,
      Pennsylvania and it was kinda weird because Anthony lost his voice and was
      very unhappy about that his vocal cords were swollen like over flowing
      african river after a big storm. It was also in the day time it is strange
      to play in the sunlight I am not used to it and the sun was shining so
      brightly on my freshly shaven head i was concerned with burning my head
      like I did once before so badly that I was in terrible pain for days and
      looked a sleestack. I slathered my self with sunblock and people were
      concerned because I looked so pale. pale not hale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lets hear it for women. WHOOHOO!! I have been thinking lately about the
      power of women........... when a woman makes a powerful piece of art or
      when a female athlete pulls off an amazing stunt it is just so much more
      impressive to me than when a man does it, i guess because women are so
      mysterious to me and their creations just retain that feminine mystique
      that I don't get from men's creations. I am in awe of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can see the light at the end of the tunnel of our U.S. tour, we have
      really played a lot of shows.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am glad to have spread something I am so proud of to a lot of places. I
      had a dream last night that I had 6 wolf puppies and they were so cute but
      i was worried about what to do when they grew up. I saw a show on tv last
      night on a guy who had a trained grizzly bear and he was rolling around on
      the ground and wrestling with it seemed like the ultimate thing to be
      doing, to be great pals with a grizzly bear. When we were kayaking in
      Alaska I saw a few Grizzly bears lumbering through the woods and wow what
      a sight to see. I cannot think of a more beautiful sight than that and
      then a few days later when our trip was over and we went into town and
      were at a bar or somewhere we met some assholes who were going to hunt
      Grizzlies with big fancy high powered laser beam guns, just wait for them
      by the river where they go to eat salmon and then shoot them in all their
      peace and glory and go home and brag about the stuffed carcass. Fucking
      disgusting people make me so sad like that. I hear though, that once in a
      while a bear will charge the hunters and the hunter will get nervous and
      misfire and get eaten by the bear.

      Here we are in Philly. When we were in Michigan we went to Blackie's house
      and partied with the wolves, it was absolutely incredible they were so
      beautiful and I could feel this immense power flowing through them, this
      amazing pure energy and it was like they completely sized me up the second
      I walked into their pen. A wolf is the most awe inspiring and intriguing
      thing on this planet. I can not think of anything that is so mysterious
      and powerful to me with the possible exception of the orca. When we got to
      D.C. a few days later John and I went and jammed with Ian Mackaye of
      Fugazi and Jerry who is kind of like the fifth Fugazi and an amazing
      drummer we had a really fun jam and then we all went down to the show at
      the Nissan pavilion and of course I was nervous cause those guys were
      watching and there is no current band that I respect more but we played
      pretty well anyways and we played again tonight in Philly and it was
      rockin I felt very focused it is like we have been touring for so long now
      that I sometimes feel overwhelmed and exhausted and felt like that today
      but when it was time to play I felt a very direct connection to the music
      and the music just was real to me. I am reading a foolish book called
      'Valley of the Dolls' foolish because it is so predictable but truthful in
      its depiction of the the sad oh so sad side of the entertainment industry
      I have never read a trashy novel like this before I wonder if it is doing
      something weird to my brain. Tomorrow hopefully we will go to the
      Philadelphia museum of art and look at the Duchamp collection there. I
      went last time we were here and it really blew my mind especially the etan
      danay that is spelled wrong for sure but that is how it sounds it is a
      piece of art that you would think is just and old door sitting there but
      when you look in a little hole in the door there is an entire landscape
      that is breathing vibrant life in the most intense way. love flea

      So we played tonight in Anthony's hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan and
      it was a really fun show. We felt loose and free and it reminded me of
      when I first met Anthony when I was 15 and I took the greyhound bus out to
      meet him in Michigan and stay at his mom's house. On the way out it was a
      hell of a bus ride and I was 15 years old and masturbating like crazy in
      the bathroom the whole time to this penthouse magazine I had and when I
      got to Michigan Anthony saw the magazine and all the pages were stuck
      together and he said whats the deal with this and i was like oh my god my
      friend lent me that magazine and I think he was jacking off isn't that
      gross? we were not admitting that we did it all the time but now I have no
      shame but I don't do it alot because I treasure my semen. When I got to
      Michigan we spent a lot of time jumping off a bridge into a river and
      sneaking around drinking beer and smoking weed with the locals, we drove
      his parents car into a ditch and went innertubing in the river we had a
      great time and we picked berries and I played trumpet in a cornfield.
      Michigan is a nice state and maybe my next wife will be from Michigan. The
      other night Woody Harrelson came out to hang with us to film one of our
      z.com episodes with us which we are doing with guest hosts and he helped
      me to do some rad yoga stretches and I beat his ass in walking on your
      hands contest and tied him in backgammon game but he beat me in standing
      still on your hands contest. Carolyn Myss is cool

      Hiya folks I am in Louisville Kentucky and last night we rocked like crazy
      and I've got a nasty coldsore on my lip and took valerian root last night
      but it must have back fired i could not sleep on the 7 hour drive from
      Milwaukee. I am naked like always when I am in my hotel room. I went to
      see Chicken Run but John and I walked out on it. It is not a great movie
      like 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' when I was a kid that really
      drove me wild and I still like it today it had held up over time unlike
      'Billy Jack'. Anyways enough talk about movies lets talk about something
      serious .......like L.A. punk rock. It is so great isn't it???? Tomata
      Duplenty was the singer for the Screamers who were intense and wild and
      had no guitars and when we started the Chili Peppers in '83 the Screamers
      were already broken up but we met Tomata because he and Anthony lived in
      the same building on Hollywood blvd and he was nice to us but all I really
      knew about him was that on the X song 'Adult Books' they say "Does anybody
      go for Tomata? Yes but he just goes for that special girl who says no" and
      I never knew what they were talking about because Tomata is gay but X
      (Billy Zoom era) was one of my favorite bands of all time even though John
      Denny doesn't think they were that great but even though he was in the
      Weirdos who rocked like crazy and sang 'Solitary Confinement' he is wrong
      about X-- they are great. So did I mention that on our first record we
      have a song called 'Granpappy Duplenty'.

      O.K. so a new fleamail I know it's been a while but I refuse to pander to
      all of you. I will not be your toy that you abuse when I go to the chat
      room. Haha just kidding, it is funny when I go to the chat room though,
      everyone tests me to see if I am really Flea and when I answer the truth
      they say "this guys an asshole, an imposter Flea would never say that" It
      is very funny. Watch I'm gonna go on the chatroom after I write this and
      this fleamail will not be on the website for a day or so I will say on the
      chatroom I am flea booga booga booga and I will be insulted, I will laugh
      but by the time you read this you will know it was me. Life is funny it is
      so funny it is hysterical

      we are playing with the greatest band they are called Blonde Redhead they
      are so exciting to play with. I am totally inspired by them they have such
      an innovative way of playing their guitars and things and the sound is so
      beautiful and I feel total love from them it is the greatest they are one
      of the best bands I have ever seen, at least definitely the best in a long
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is our last leg with the Foo Fighters it has been great to play with
      them the crowd loves them so much and when they play that song 'Everlong'
      I
    </p>
    <p>
      always love it even though I have seen them play about 80 thousand times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last night Chad and members of the Fighters principally Dave and Taylor
      destroyed their dressing room to little bits. They are very tough
      customers those drummers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shaved my pubes off the other day it looks really funny. I was in the
      shower after the show and Chad walked in and I said Chad I shaved my pubes
      and he said oh dont forget to trim the potatoes. We are in St. Louis right
      now. Kresta KNight is a swell girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sitting in my hotel room and watching the movie Magnolia it makes me
      nervous. I will write more fleamail more frequently I promise.

      I am in Salt Lake City. It is a town that I do not really understand, I
      just know that Karl Malone killed a panther on tv and it was really lame,
      the panther was cornered in a cave and he came and shot and then held its
      dead body up in the air and waved it around like he was a big brave
      hunter...........what a shameless display of cowardly behavior and
      cruelty. There a lot of mormons here that I know for sure and I don't know
      anything about them either except that Steve Young is a descendant of
      Brigham young and that I always confuse them with the Amish. Do the
      mormons rock polygamy? Stormin' Norman was my favorite basketball player
      when I was coming up. As a band we are good, the obligatory bumps and
      bruises and whatnot and it is an emotional test to be at such close
      quarters with people for such a long period of time but at least we all
      love each other and shit. We do rock like fucking crazy. Before we went on
      this tour I went to Fairfax High school my alma mater and played for the
      kids in the music department along with Steven Perkins on percussion and a
      guy called Willie played a little trumpet, it felt great to play for them
      and talk to them in such an intimate way. It was really scary for me, to
      be so closely confronted with people, not playing a big loud rock show
      that I am used to doing, but I got used to it after a few minutes and we
      played pretty well. I felt very naked there...I think if I did that kind
      of thing more often it would be great for my playing.

      Hello I am in Washington D.C. the home of Bill Clinton's penis and Fugazi.
      Fugazi is so great never forget it, they are the most exciting guitar band
      in the world and they rock the hardest. We got here at about 3:30 this
      morning and checked into our plush hotel and slept like little pigs in a
      blanket. There seems to be a cold spreading through the ranks of crew and
      band members of all the bands, ay matey the scurvy is spreading. All is
      well though, it is a lot of jamming we are doing and I love to rock.
      Anthony had hurt his lower back I believe it is sacrum or his coossix bone
      down there and is having to be pretty still to avoid severe pain and it is
      curtailing some of his more bodacious stage moves, but redirecting his
      energy to other artistic places of importance. My little girl is out on
      the road with me and I am very happy about that, we are having fun and
      going to the museum today, which is a day off. I remember that the first
      fleamail I ever wrote was from this town after we played a radio show here
      last year sometime, and now here we are again, ready to rock and sounding
      better than we did back then, growing and growing, knowing and knowing. I
      dance alot on stage. I dance alot on stage. I dance alot on stage. My body
      feels it. Skidalee bidalee bop. Up jumped the cock, the moon came down and
      the booty frowned and the feminist movement I mock.

      I am in st. Louis the Laker game is about to start so I have my Laker get
      uo on and I am about to go up to Anthony's room and watch it because
      somehow he ended up with a suite with a big tv., not to mention that he is
      one of my closest friends in the world and a true Laker fan. Last night in
      Iowa City was a good show the jam at the end Of "search and Destroy' was
      rockin' anyways, and We are getting to feel good again after the days
      off.............. I feel like I am forcing it sometimes and need to chill
      out and let the intensity come to me and not force it. I am practicing
      with my pick so I can play Parallel again, I never play with a pick so I
      am kind of lame at it, but I am brushing up by playing along with Punk
      records in my room. I played along with the cd 'Fear the record', cause I
      know all the songs I used to be in the band circa 82/83. I was a crazy kid
      and they were older and more mature than me, I was never really
      comfortable in that band, never could really be myself, but it was a great
      learning experience and that 1st record they made is great outside of the
      rampant homophobia, musically it an innovative and exciting record. Today
      I sampled a bunch of drum sounds all afternoon then accidentally erased
      them, wasted a lot of work....... FUCK!!!!!!!!!!

      Hi I am in Indiana. The home of Larry Bird and Beth Bladen. We are staying
      at a nice old hotel and I am bursting with sexual energy. I just got up
      from a small nap. It is hot im my room and time for me to eat some room
      service food unless I can find maybe some indian food somewhere. It is
      time for me to say Marvin Pontiac is the shit There is a c.d coming out
      next week that I would like everyone to know about. It is the greatest
      hits of an artist named Marvin Pontiac a man some people think of as an
      insane maniacal lunatic and some think of as an ethereal genius, I just
      think of him as an scintillating musician and performer his the shit is
      just awesome to listen to and it always makes me feel good. This is
      something worthwhile for your earholes. He was revered as a god during his
      life and ended up in the Esmerelda State Mental Institution in his later
      years................. the mutha fucka straight out rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond that, we played last night in Roanoke, Virginia, where god was. It
      was great to be there and during the day I had nice stroll around the
      place and some ridiculously good spinach soup at a nice little cafe where
      I sat with my shirt off feeling the hot sun on my back, I saw some kids
      playing drums and trumpet in the street and I felt like part of the human
      race. I just typed hymen race by accident but went back and fixed it.....
      the show last night rocked, all the shows have been great except possibly
      the 1ast couple in Minny and Wisconsin because we were all not in
      excellent health, but we are on top now and soaring it feels good, inside
      the music is the place to be. We did the the best we could, under the
      circumstances in those towns, we just had to face a few hardships.

    <p>Hello folks</p>
    <p>
      I am in Boston at a fancy hotel eating asparagus. It was 14 hour bus ride
      last night to get here and I am a little spacey. The gigs have been
      rockin' the tour is going great, the music is satisfying everyone is
      healthy food is yimmy we are making people happy I could ask for nothing
      else. I have a bunch of recording equipment with me and I have been
      recording some fun music in my room. it a great feeling. I have been
      reading a book called ' The Hours' by a guy called Michael Cunningham I
      like it a lot, it uses names and references of characters from the book
      'Mrs. Dalloway' by Virginia Wolf and is quite ingenious. Last night we
      arrived to the gig in Columbus, Ohio and I was asleep and Louis our road
      manager came in and said "Flea we're here at the gig and we're going on
      early, the Foo Fighters have canceled Dave Grohl is sick it's coming out
      at both ends" I found that quite amusing to hear........ not that Dave was
      sick of course but that I better wake up because it was coming out at both
      ends. I was delirious at the time. I'm sure all will be well and we will
      be joined by the Foo's in all their magnificence tomorrow night in
      Amherst.

    <p>Hi everybody</p>
    <p>
      I have not felt like writing y'all in some time.... other parts in my life
      have just been taking precedence. We have begun out U.S. tour now though
      and it is so great to be touring here in the states. I feel very
      comfortable in our bus and it is great to not have to be in planes all the
      time, so much more mellow and less stressful to be in the bus. I love the
      fucking bus. I feel in a great way about our music now, it is just flowing
      through, I am totally surrendering to it, it is awesome. I bought a new
      Callichio trumpet before we left town and it is a great feeling to blow
      notes through it, so nice, no electricity just air and brass and lips and
      god. The place I bought it at is such an amazing place, where great
      craftsman make the most beautiful instruments, it is fun to be there and
      watch them do their thing, hammering metal into these horns which are
      played by the likes of the great Freddie Hubbard. I was just sitting on
      the bus blowing it. I am reading 'the prophet' by Kahil Gibran it makes me
      happy. Bring it on let it come down.

      So the gloomiest days can turn around and life can be so full of joy of
      the human experience and pain can become a meaningful lesson and human
      contact can revive feelings of bliss and ecstasy and life can be great. I
      had the nicest night tonight in Sydney and the air smells sweet and soft
      and the breeze is washing out the stagnant parts of my body and I love the
      universe. We rocked the entertainment center in Sydney last night and
      music feels so real and flowing like waves and breath. I am so grateful
      for everything. I met a nice man who gave me acupuncture. the song
      'Acupuncture' by George Clinton and the P-funk All Stars is a great song I
      think it was written by Blackbyrd McKnight the great guitar player. Check
      out Eric Dolphy's version of 'God Bless the Child' that he did on bass
      clarinet for the album 'The Berlin Concerts' it is the most beautiful
      thing you will ever hear and it will make you smarter and a more whole
      person.

      So we are on tour in Australia. When we arrived in Sydney I came down with
      the worst flu of my life and it's been kind of hard to get straight since
      then, I just need rest and I'm not gonna get that till the 7th so it is
      time to suck it up. These shows have been good, at the Big Day Out in
      Brisbane I was feeling kind of weak and dizzy and just didn't have it in
      me to really surrender my body to the music the way I usually do, but
      besides that they have been good, especially the Entertainment Center in
      Brisbane was rockin like nobody's business. The Nine Inch Nails are great
      to see, the music has so much in the way of melody and rhythm and
      intensity, I really love that band. The thing that has caused me the most
      goosebumps though is Joe Strummer. He sings and plays with infinite soul
      and conviction and the songs are so amazing that I cannot listen without
      being completely engrossed in his feeling. He is the best. We play another
      Big Day Out today in Sydney. I am going down to the show early to do radio
      interview, would rather be sleeping till the last minute but duty calls.

      Well we have one more show in Japan. It has been pretty cool here, the
      fans have been very attentive to our music and warm and supportive on all
      fronts. For me it had kind of a weird leg, I have been feeling kind of
      tired and sad, but that is just a cycle and I'll be cycling upwards to
      lightness and joy soon, never you mind, I shouldn't even of bought it up
      in the first place. At the show tonight before we played 'me and my
      friends' to end the show I WENT OUT INTO the crowd to give my bass to
      someone but the people started jumping all over me and I accidentally hit
      one girl in the head while trying to defend myself, so I brought her up to
      the side of the stage and then I gave her my bass, she was very sweet.
      After I show I met a very sweet girl named Akane who's outpouring of
      emotion was very touching.

      If anyone knows where I can get an early 60's pre CBS fender jazz bass it
      would be great if they could let me know, I really want one and don't know
      where to get it. If I get one I will never smash it or give it away.

    <p>Hello all of you.</p>
    <p>
      We are in Tokyo, here playing at place called Budokan a venue made famous
      in America by it's Cheap Trick live album and a horde of ridiculous hair
      bands in the 80's. I have never given a shit for the hair bands of the
      80's with their shitty sounding attempts at being bigger than life and
      retarded sexuality. They were like a bad cartoon, but they took it
      seriously................. However, Budokan is a cool venue and sounds
      great. It is strange to play in Japan, We are strange to them and they are
      strange to us. The crowds have been warm to us though and outside of a
      minor temper tantrum by me the other night over a set list argument
      backstage we have been having a good time. I am playing now with earplugs
      because the sheer volume of our rock power was causing me great pain, and
      it is a disorienting effect to get used to the softness of the music with
      the plugs in, I am starting to become accustomed to it though and
      hopefully it will stop me from having to wear a hearing aid within the
      next few years, or one of those headphone sets like Neil Young has, or
      having bird ear cartilage implanted in my ringing ears..... I long to see
      other parts of Japan, to get out of the city to the rural areas, away from
      the hustle and bustling imitations of western culture and experience the
      traditional parts of Japan which excite me. Alas, I shall not. When we
      have a few days off after playing Osaka, I shall beam for Australia and
      soak my body in the big blue before beginning the touring over there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am reading a book called My Other Life by Paul Theroux it is great. We
      had fun playing on our California run. San Francisco in particular was a
      rockin' show, but I took this herbal shit called guarana and it damn near
      blue my head off, I was on fire at the gig but after was up all night
      pacing around my room and gringing my teeth and masturbating. It was like
      speed, guarana does not agree with me. Flea needs to relax and be calm and
      not stress. Last night Dickie cut all of John's hair off and it looks
      great. Dickie is our friend who is here with us shooting a film of our
      tour and he used to sing in the 'Too Free Stooges' who were a very funny
      band. He has a stiff neck.

      We are in Las Vegas, such a weird place, the crystallization of the
      american dream, money, steak dinners, showgirls, whores, entertainment,
      Siegfried and Roy, and Danny Gans the entertainer of the year. They have
      rollercoasters, Giant pyramids as big as in Egypt, the New York city
      skyline, Caesars Palace, and they used to have the most exciting college
      basketball team in the country with manchild players that toyed with the
      rest of the mere mortal college students until there frreaky coach that
      ate towels got fired for sneaking around the rules somehow. Mike Tyson
      lives here. Yesterday when we went to rehearse for the t.v. show we are
      here to do, Mike Tyson was there hanging out and I he came and said hello
      to me and gave me a hug. I wanted to tell him how I excited I was to see
      he had a tattoo of Che Guevara on his tummy and ask him if he had read the
      biography on Che by Jon Lee Anderson(???) but I was too nervous too see
      him and just muttered out a quick "I love you" and scurried back to my
      band and crewmates. I also wanted to ask him if he had ever received the
      song I wrote for him and recorded, which is an homage to him I wrote when
      he was released from jail the first time but I didn't get it together to
      do that either, oh well maybe I'll see him at the show tomorrow. Last
      week, after we returned from Europe I spent some time in the most
      beautiful place on the central coast of California all ocean and mountains
      and elephant seals so to be here now just a more surreal event than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way here I met a Tibetan Bhuddist monk on the airplane who was very
      kind and he gave me a gift and put me in an amazingly happy mood, it was
      inspiring to see this guy so devoted to love and peace and to feel his
      presence so connected to god. I have a red string around my neck now that
      he gave me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh well, we play one song here tomorrow night then we go home. Out here in
      the desert. I am having lunch with Wayne Newton today. We will drink Gin
      martinis and laugh about old times.

      I am in the airport in London. We played last night in Lisbon then I slept
      2 hours and got up and flew to london where we have a 3 hour layover till
      the flight to l.a.. Needless to say, I am burnt to a little crisp. God
      bless Quentin Crisp.

    <p>
      This tour was yet another chapter in the ongoing chili pepper saga which
      somehow managed to become the story of my life 17 years ago. It is still
      bizarre to me that our little band continues to travel around the world
      and communicate as much as we do. At this point, I just think it is all
      about John Frusciante............. lets face it, the guy is a fucking
      dedicated genius. I have never known anyone to work as hard and as
      consistently as him at anything. He could give a fuck about the result, he
      loves the process, he lives to create, to let the power of the universe
      flow through him, he is the most pure artist I know of. I am honored and
      fortunate to play with him, history will remember him as a virtuoso artist
      of our time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Enigmatic and ubiquitous Blackman has informed me that some people out
      there are interested in my basses and whatnot. So........ I play a modulus
      bass and I use mesa boogie cabinets and Galien Kruger heads. I have never
      studied the bass formally, I rely on intuition and emotional and spiritual
      energy to guide me as a bass player......................... What I really
      want right now is a vintage fender jazz bass though so I can be as cool as
      John Paul Jones.

    <p>
      With the passing of Paul Bowles recently I feel compelled to comment. Paul
      Bowles, the great expatriate writer of novels and short stories and
      letters is a man who touched me deeply with his incredible ability to tell
      an interesting story in an exciting, visceral and poetic way. Through his
      books I gained an understanding of muslim culture and a yearning to travel
      to exotic lands and of course a desire to smoke kif until my head fell
      off. He was also a great composer of music and the first person to record
      music of indigenous peoples of North Africa. 'The Spider's House' is one
      of the best books I ever read and he enriched my life immensely.

      I am glad to be going home now, all I want to do is hug my little girl.

      So here I am in Bordeaux, France, it is 4 am and I'm reading, not ready to
      sleep yet, thinking about my life and I decide to check my email and there
      is one saying that the people who took my fela pants HAVE DECIDED TO
      RETURN THEM TO ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am so happy about that. I am so
      grateful to these girls for seeing the error of their ways and returning
      my pants that were one of a kind and hand made and that I love, the pants
      that had become the missing piece of the puzzle of our fela suits. Thank
      you girls, I hold no resentment to you for taking them, I understand. I
      have done worse. My heart feels warm.

    <p>
      Meanwhile, we are touring away out here, played Paris and Bordeaux since I
      last wrote. I had a great time in Paris and had yummy chocolate cake and
      crepes. The only bad thing was that my dvd of 'The March of the Wodden
      Soldiers' is not working.

      kind and really mean a lot to me, and are not worth any money at all. As
      material possessions go, they are close to my heart. They were taken out
      of the room where I meditate and warm up for the shows and is a sacred
      place to me. If anyone knows who has the pants or has them I would be so
      happy to get them back with no questions asked, and will put the person
      who returns them on the guest list for chili pepper guest list forever to
      all of our shows..... thank you

      Hello how are you? I am fine. That is how I started every letter I wrote
      up 'til age 15 or so. We are in Switzerland at the moment and have the
      night off. I can't remember where I wrote from last, but we just keep
      moving keep doing our thing. The shows are just smokin' our band is in top
      form I am fucking proud and inspired by this whole thing right now. To be
      honest though, I really miss my daughter and my dogs and I'm pretty ready
      to go home for a little while.......... 11 more days. I love playing, but
      the beauty of my own bed and just any ridiculous conversation with Clara
      would make me super happy right now.

      I can't really think of anything out of the ordinary to report, we have a

      or 5 in the morning. I got this cool thing on my computer where I can
      listen to the laker games and I do it in the wee hours, it is a real
      pleasure.............. we just rock and travel, rock and travel, I look
      forward every night to the time on stage, in the most chaotic moments of

    <p>Hi</p>
    <p>
      I am in Foggy London. we played last night and it was a pretty cool show
      and a guy I kinda know via email gave me a cassette of old chili peppers
      demo taped that I have been listening to and it is a real fucking trip
      down memory lane. I am listening right now to a version of 'If You Want Me
      to Stay' with George Clinton singing and I just remember how excited and
      fulfilled I felt at the time.... Me in the same room the with the great
      mythological hero Dr. Funkenstein, him singing with our band, fuck I was
      in heaven............... George was so warm and kind to us I will never
      ever forget his cosmically great vibe and will always be in awe of his
      incredibly vast contribution to the music world. Thanks rod brakes........
      oh but there is a lot of shit on that tape that is not us, about half of
      it is impostor. Regarding this whole chat room thing, first of all, I was
      just joking about that guy Clowny and so was he, I would have told me to
      fuck off too and I hope everyone is cool with him when he comes in the
      chat room. It was no bad vibe when I left the chat room that night I just
      might have been a little frustrated that no one knew it was me because I
      wanted to share my experience with all of y'all.. So, anyway, Evidently
      there is gonna be a new thing hooked up by next week, where people have to
      register to go on there and then I will be the only flea so you will
      always no when it is me.

      manager Louis is having a bad day, he was even bummed because I criticized

      such a cool crew and overall operation, just a big family and it gets

      behind us on stage now, but we don't really have images that we like to

      So tonight was a night of Gothenburg and despite all of my basses
      completely fucking up it was a fun night and I think our band is really
      starting to get into a good groove. Maybe it's just that I am feeling a
      lot happier with myself, but I think that we have never been better. It
      sure gets cold on these Scandinavian stages though, I had to put on a
      shirt at the end of the show, that's a change, I was putting on clothes at
      the end. At the end of the show tonight I dared Anthony to eat the set
      list which he did he'll be pooping paper and ink tomorrow. The Lakers won
      yesterday in Utah. yahoo. Yesterday while I was reading East of Eden by
      John Steinbeck, in between bouts of reading I was listening to the Genesis
      cd "Foxtrot" I have never really listened to that band before and I was
      enjoying it very much. I then realized that the book I was reading is
      loosely based on the book of genesis in the bible. What I'm trying to say
      is it was a genesis thing yesterday. I am giving birth to something right
      now and it is really good.

      I was in the chat room again first as myself then as bob. I wish there was
      a way I could really let everyone know it is me, but I guess that's the
      mystery of the whole thing. Any way..... HI GoBassGirl!...... I'm glad you
      liked the video, maybe I would do an instructional video again but I would
      have to think about it a little more than last time when I had no idea
      what I was gonna do and just showed up with my pal.

      I'm justa sittin' here in Sweden one of those kinda bored nights, I just

      one more time it was me again in the chat room. talked to Crazy Grrl and
      NdRew69(who didn't believe it was me) and Maria Eugenia who was very
      friendly and Maizee from Philly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just relaxin' today in Philly, went shopping to get Anthony a BIRTHDAY
      PRESENT but everything was closed since it was Sunday, shit I have to get
      him something in time, might have to make something tonight of some kind.
      I am still totally delirious with this time change thing. Basketball
      season starts soon and flea is very excited. I love basketball so much and
      seeing this is the new Phil Jackson era it bodes very well for my team. I
      think Phil Jackson is a very smart level headed and aware man, and will be
      well respected by the players for his insight and ability to understand
      the situation at hand. I read his book 'Sacred Hoops". He is aware of
      himself and therefor is able to be aware of what is going on around him.
      His coaching style is not rigid but something that is always unfolding
      flexible as time is flexible. At the same time, he is a disciplined
      student and teacher of the game. Who hoo!!!!!!!! I love L.A.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a most unflattering picture of me today in the L.A. Times
      because I sold my house. It felt strange to have my personal business
      paraded around in the real estate section of the newspaper.......... oh
      well. Life in the public eye continues. It must be really hard to be
      Mohammed Ali or the Pope. Ali sure seems to do a good job of it though. I
      guess it's not that hard to be famous, just different. It's all fine when
      people see the pretty and confident and creative side, it's when they see
      the fear and darkness and unattractive things is when it gets kind of
      scary. Everything's just a little bit more extreme........ all the
      lessons. It's amazing how mislead the press always is though, about the
      truth. The little bit that I know about a few talked about people's lives,
      and then and I read the total fabrication in the press, always filling in
      the empty spaces with guesses and printing it like it is the truth. It is
      just soo silly. It is a charade, A charade I say.

      so you know it's me. We played Helsinki for 2 nights it was really fun, I
      had a blast tonight, except we didn't play Savior and I really wanted to.
      I smashed my shins on the corner on the stage at the end of the set when I

      So here we are in Helsinki, all upside down and it is 5:30 in the a.m. but
      I am up and sitting in front of this computer screen.

    <p>
      Just came from NewYork where we played on the World Trade Center and it
      was kind of a weird gig, kind of stiff and like that in an office building
      where people must have felt a little constricted or something except for
      this one cat in Led Zeppelin t shirt who seemed to be feeling the spirit.
      I mean it seemed like everyone was having a good time and all. it just
      didn't really break on through to the other side despite the girl with
      chocolate skin and straight hair and the bold and friendly stare. We
      debuted are new brightly colored Fela suits there, they are out of this
      world and dapper like a motherfucker, but a bit constricting, and John was
      especially bumming out 'cause he couldn't get into his comfy rock pose and
      really do his thing like he and we and anyone with the ability to think
      and feel loves him too. Then John and I went to eat sushi and hang out
      with some very nice people and had a wonderful evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      then we flew to helsinki and it took all night. Got here slept a little
      strolled some ate some, watched the great film 'Menace to Society' and
      then a twilight Zone 'To Serve Man' and then hit the hay for 2 hours and
      then up and confused and write this letter.

      Mexico was great. Yesterday on our day off we went to the home of Frida
      Kahlo and Diego Rivera. I was excited about seeing the home I had seen so
      many pictures of but was surprised to see that there were several
      paintings by both Frida and Diego there. I am personally drawn to the
      Frida ones, she just blows my mind by whole heartedly embracing
      everything, the darkest of tragedy, and the most childlike innocence. She
      also is so gorgeous that I am just in awe of her and the fact that such
      radical thinking could go hand in hand with such stunning physical beauty.
      ...Mexico City must have been such an exciting place in the 30's and
      40's.............. such an epicenter of art and idealism. This is very
      romantic to me. When there exists a core of something so intense that is
      shared by a few people in a certain area, that becomes so influential to
      the energy of the universe, this is very romantic and exciting to me. the
      surrealists, the punk rockers, the early greek philosophers, the hard
      boppers, the doo woppers, these movements just change everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      we are going home tomorrow, we played tonight and the crowd was really
      fucking warm and kind.

    <p>Hello</p>
    <p>
      Mexico City, where Tina Modotti was sexy and stunningly talented. And Bold
      ....We had a fucked day of travel today, got up at 5 am and flew for 12
      hours from Sao Paulo on Aero Mexico. Everyone is tired but I'm sure Chad
      will go out and party all night anyway. Playing in Argentina was amazing,
      one of the greatest crowds I ever have felt. I truly felt an incredible
      amount of love from those people, they even sang along with the guitar
      melody of the bridge of 'Blood Sugar Sex Magic'. I feel Argentina in my
      blood. We then went on to Brazil, where some boys approached me in the
      park and I had the feeling they were gonna attempt to fuck with me in some
      way, when a neighborly member of the Chili Pepper fan club approached and
      diffused the situation in a suave and Portuguese way. I'll tell ya one
      thing, they sure like to kiss in Brazil. I must have kissed a thousand
      people... twice each. Now we are in La Ciudad de Mejico the home of our
      beloved road manager Louis Mathieu, whose family will be coming to the
      show tomorrow. I understand his dad is a great golfer. John and I and
      Chris Warren our affable drum technician have formed the Gentlemen's film
      club, a manly organization that meets nightly to watch arty films with
      subtitles. This is a very exclusive club catering to all fans of Porky's
      3. that's all I have to say to you right now.

      So now we are in Buenos Aires. I love this city. I would love it even more
      if last night when on my way to the stage and feeling rather sprightly I
      decided to try the splits and a big stretch when I heard and felt a
      ripping in my left buttock. I have pulled a muscle in my ass and it is
      slowing me down. It hurts to do my best stage moves but I'll have to think
      of some new ones less stressful to my delicate bottom.

    <p>Ola</p>
    <p>
      Yo estoy en Santiago, una ciudad muy bonita y cerca de los Andes. Soy muy
      feliz porque los inhabitantes de Santiago son muy sincero y tienen
      corazones fuertes....... That's about the limit of my feeble spanish which
      I mercilessly unload upon the folks of any latin country I find myself in.
      It is great to be here in Santiago, the air is so crisp with Autumn
      freshness and the Andes are guarding this place in a motherly and
      comforting way which sets my soul at ease. We got in this morning at about
      6 am and took naps and then I strolled around the river which I don't know
      the name of but it sits in front of our hotel and is fast and brown. I saw
      many couples romantically embracing by the river, and it filled me with
      hope and only a tinge of sadness. There were several people wanting
      autographs in the restaurant and in front of the hotel, but they were
      polite and courteous and I felt happy to oblige them once I had rocked the
      local ceviche............. I love South America, I think it is my favorite
      part of the world, with the possible exception of Big Sur, California, and
      this is my 1st time in Chile. I cannot help but imagine Ernesto rocking
      through here on his motorcycle and making life meaningful. Tomorrow we do
      a little press then play concerts for 2 nights for the 1st ever in Chile
      and it makes me think of when our band first started and Anthony had some
      hats made for us which said 'The Red Hot Chile Peppers' and Hillel and I
      laughed so hard. They were baseball caps and we cut off the front bills
      and sported them all around. Everybody should hear the new c.d. by the
      band Bicycle Thief which is soulful and great.... I have been listening to
      the new Nine Inch Nails relentlessly it is the greatest fucking thing I
      have ever heard. Trent Reznor has such an original idea of rhythm and
      space and it just rocks my world. They will be playing with us on the Big
      Day Out tour in Australia and I am very excited about that. Oh well, I
      reckon I'll mosey on down to El Cid y comer mucho con mis amigos.

    <p>
      Here in New York typing on my new dope ass motherfucking g3 computer. It
      is slicker than banana shit to watch dvd's on it whilst flying around the
      land, it is making traveling way more pleasant. Watched Double Indemnity
      and Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Nearly three twilight zone episodes so
      far. We played the Much Music video awards last night, it was pretty fun,
      they let us be loose and jam how we felt like which was nice considering
      it always sucks to hang around a tv show all day and then play for 5
      minutes. Today we did the Chris Rock show in N.Y. and it went ok I guess
      it is so hard to tell what happens in such a brief performance. But for
      sure I know that Chris Rock is a really nice guy with a good heart and it
      was good to be a part of his thing 'cause he is funny and smart. I also
      got to meet Allen Iverson who is the most exciting basketball player in
      the world (too bad he's not on the Lakers) and that felt really special, I
      just love basketball so much and this guy is like a mythological hero to
      me, I think that basketball players are the last people that I get totally
      starstruck by they just seem so superhuman to me, that they can achieve
      such astronomical skill and it looks so pretty and all..............
      Anyway, back home tomorrow for a few days I miss Clara terribly.

      We are headed tomorrow to play the much music awards in Toronto. We are
      playing with David Bowie one of jonour all time heroes and it is really a
      great blessing to do that. The next day we are moseying on to New York to
      do the Chris Rock show. On that show will be Allen Iverson who is another
      great man and I will probably be really nervous if I get to meet him
      because I respect him so much. ......I want to tell Yukiko Nakamura that
      we will do all we can to give them the best fucking show we can in Japan
      and send love to the land of Kurosawa and Abe and Mishima. I was very
      pleased today to see the Australian troops along with the Kiwis and the
      brits head into East Timor to try and stop the the insane bloodshed in
      that place. It is amazing and confusing to me to try and understand how

      Well we go home tomorrow and have a couple of weeks off before we do a
      couple of tv shows in the states and then head for South America. This was
      a good tour,.. If I can really get myself together to be calm and peaceful
      touring will just get funner and funner. We played a tv show in an arena
      in Verona tonight, just 2 songs and out. A lot of other bands played but
      they all lip synched. Even Sting faked it, which disappointed me 'cause
      even though I don't particularly dig his current musical aesthetic I
      always thought he was a serious musician who held music as a sacred thing.
      oh well...... Home to L.A. in the morning. Orange Claw Hamer rules.

      Today I went horse riding with Clara, Anthony and my mother. We were
      having a fine time in the italian countryside when at a full gallop my
      horse ran under a low branch which hit me in the stomach and knocked me
      off my horse. Clara said she saw me do a back flip high in the air and
      then hit the ground on my chest. All I know is I blacked out and woke up
      lying in the grass in a lot of pain. No serious injuries though, just all
      scraped up and sore as shit and I know it'll be worse tomorrow. Clara fell
      off her horse too which started acting crazy after I fell but she only
      scraped her cheek. I feel very lucky that I didn't break my neck. Well at
      least it happened at the end of this leg of touring while we have a couple
      of days off. Listening to Lee Scratch Perry all day. I love him

      Here we are in Italy in Verona home of Romeo and Juliet. Now it is the
      home of Flea and Clara. We are at the ass end of our tour and is nice to
      end up here in Italy where we can stuff our faces with pasta. We are doing
      a tv show here and will be on the same bill with Ricky Martin. I am going
      to insist on Ricky Martin coming up to sing YOUR PUSSIE'S GLUED TO A
      BUILDING ON FIRE as a duet with John. Tomorrow is a day off and I am going
      horse riding with Clara. I got a wicked amount of Fela Kuti records in
      England. We rocked Reading pretty hard and Leeds too and Clara got to hang
      with Sporty Spice.

      Hi everybody it's me flea. We've been on tour now for a while and it's
      been a lot of fun and a lot of work and a lot of things have happened
      between us but first let me talk about something. I was forwarded some
      emails of people complaining bitterly about the length of our shows,
      feeling that they did not get enough for their $$$. The Red Hot Chili
      Peppers have always played for just a little over an hour, maybe an hour
      and a half tops because that is what has felt right. We have always tried
      to pace our shows with a set and with a length that we feel is the most
      exciting show for our audience. I can just say that from my experience
      coming from the punk rock aesthetic that inspired me when the red hots
      began that I always enjoyed the nofrills no fucking around hit it and quit
      it mentality that I grew up with in the punk rock scene. I have always
      found that bands that play for 2 hours or so or more bore the shit out of
      me and I have never been really touched by a concert that long and I find
      it pompous, bloated, and unnecessary. However, if the majority of our
      audience really feels that we play for too short an amount of time we will
      definitely play longer... let us know. It would be nice to be polite about
      it, I guess I figure we have always given our all to our crowd no matter
      what the circumstance. Also, we definitely would have played more songs
      like Californication and Otherside off of the new record but Anthony has
      had a bad throat infection and it was difficult for him to sing them.
      And.... to those of you who complained in your emails about our opening
      act Jah Wobble that played with us in Paris and with us and Silverchair in
      Niems I have to say that Jah wobble is one of the greatest bass players in
      the history of rock music I thought he was the best opening act we ever
      had. I was moved to tears and really fucking embarrassed by the way he was
      treated by the crowd. He is one of my biggest influences and I thought his
      show was incredible.........................................
      Anyway......... we played in russia and it was really fucking cool, a
      zillion people in Red Square on a beautiful night and all that history and
      the opportunity to play there was just magic. I went to visit the house of
      Mikael Bulgakov and it was really amazing for me, he is just one of my
      favorite writers of all of time and the house that he lived in is this old
      fucked up apartment building covered in graffiti of quotes of his books
      and drawings of the characters of his masterpiece THE MASTER AND
      MARGHUERITA I didn't spell it right I know but it was a very touching
      experience for me even though I had to avoid the puddles of urine left by
      all his literary fans. Also, Tuta Larsen of mtv russia is the most amazing
      woman in the world.... Since then we have just been moving and playing and
      I feel like we keep getting better, I can't wait to make another record.
      Playing the Reading festival tomorrow I am in London right now. My
      daughter is a genius.

      Love to all. Woodstock was a fucking gas. We rocked, had fun and got the
      fuck out of there before we knew what had happened. Got there 3 hours
      before we played did some press, I got into a rare arguement with John,
      made up with John and then we hit it. Don't know about all those fires and
      vandalism and shit, it all felt good to me... I feel like I can usually
      tell if the energy at a gig is dangerous or volatile, and it just did not
      feel that way to me. I just didn't like when guys would grab at the girls
      who had their tops off. Guys think and look at fantasize about girl tits
      all day and finally the girl are nice and free enough to let them flow and
      guys abuse the beauty of it all by groping without invitation........ some
      nerve..... Anyway..... Fela Kuti rules the world.

      Hi. Did press all afternoon in Toronto today. It was not so pleasant for
      me today, I just couldn't bear answering the same questions again and
      trying to be sincere about it. That's ok, I'm a professional, I'll get
      over it, as long as the deli tray is right at woodstock....Listening to
      the new GZA/GENIUS cd. It is fucking incredible. John and I went to see
      the film The Buena Vista Social Club, it was so beautiful, it made me
      really want to go to Cuba and reminded me how much I love Che Guevara even
      though the movie had nothing to do with him, and he's not even Cuban.

      Hi it's me Flea. We just played outdoors in the middle of Toronto to a
      whole bunch of people. We rocked great except when the roadies fucked up
      and my bass cut out for 5 minutes, but during that time John played "YOUR
      PUSSIE'S GLUED TO A BUILDING ON FIRE" and it was great anyways. The time
      off was great and I went To Costa Rica and it was fun and I surfed.
      Feeling vibrant and the band sounds great. A little press today and
      tomorrow (when will it ever end?) and we play Woodstock on Sunday. I'm
      eating some tuna now and broccoli too. Going out in a few to some tv. ACDC
      rocks. Everybody knows it. I can't believe people still get duped by all
      the backstreet boys kind of shit. You'd think by now people would'a
      figured out who's playing music and who's not.

      I am now home. I got a nasty cold at the end and it got hard to be sick
      and tired and go rock and fly around the world. But it was still a great
      tour and inspired my faith in my band more and more. The last shows were
      in L.A. and San Francisco, and I was pretty spaced at them but did my best
      to give all I had. At one point I was doing a radio interview before the
      show in San Francisco, and had no idea what I was saying and my voice was
      disconnected from my brain completely. In L.A. at the end of the show I
      had an altercation with the bouncers and smashed all the equipment and it
      was a great fucking release for all the tension I had been feeling since I
      couldn't sleep in Italy and then got sick and just felt out of it for the
      last week. All in all I am just so grateful for everyone coming to see us
      play, though I wish all the shows were up to the standard that makes us so
      happy, but we run on emotion and are not machine like at all and that's
      the way it goes. Now I am home and have a belly full of sushi AND A LOT
      LESS cum. I will sleep tonight, and surf soon and write music in my
      garage. We are playing a benefit concert at the Hollywood Palladium on
      friday and Eddie Vedder is going to play too. And Mike Watt, think. think
      think think tinktktkponvwitgu. I love my band. I need only peace in my own
      brain and then my life will be perfect. I am a drop of a tear from the eye
      of god. I love water.

      and eat and take nice naps and have lots of babies. I am exhausted have
      not been sleeping hardly at all, my mind is always racing... everyone else
      in the band is doing great though, happy and healthy. We are really
      feeling lucky to get to rock the way we do. I'm gonna try to buy a suit

      We played tonight in London at the Camden Palace. We rocked good and funky
      and sweet. Sometimes when I look at John when I'm playing I just want to
      cry because there is so much love for music coming from his heart. After
      the show I ate and talked a little bit and when I went to leave the club
      and get into a car to drive away there were people standing outside who
      wanted my autograph. One guy grabbed my arm and was very intense saying
      please flea please please... I was freaked out and then yelled at him GET
      THE FUCK OFF OF ME and then got in the car and drove away. I feel bad
      about it because I know he really cared about the band and just wanted
      something to remember his experience by and I yelled in his face. If he by
      chance reads this I am apologizing to him. I kinda lost it because I am
      far from perfect. We then went to a fancy party which was given by
      Donatella Versace. It is unlike me to hangout at those things, and I am
      kind of a social misfit in that way, but I eventually relaxed and had a
      nice time. I went to pee and a security guy grabbed me and said that
      toilet is only for special people, pushed me out of the way and I already
      had my dick out. It was bizarre... Then someone who I know who is famous
      arranged for me to pee. I was going to call my lawyer to get my agent to
      fax my manager about it , but I would have wet my pants by then.

      Hello everyone. I'm in London and I'm going a little crazy from lack of
      sleep because I'm a freak. I couldn't write from Stockholm or Paris but we
      rocked in those places and they are beautiful cities. We have been doing
      lots of tv shows and it is weird cause you have to sit around there all
      day and you just get to play a few songs, it's like all the stuff I hate
      without the payoff. But I feel like a rocker anyway. In france I walked
      around and looked at the big and old pretty buildings and pretended I was
      something of a sophisticate, running around drinking little coffees and
      shit. In Stockholm the kids were making a big racket because it was the
      last day of school. I'm looking forward to coming back to Europe to play
      the festivals in August. That's the way I really like it, rocking out in
      the sunshine feeling like I got a reason. It's exciting to me that our
      record is out, thinking about people hearing it all over the world is a
      crazy feeling. I'm listening to Stevie Wonder right now... to the visions
      in our minds... Stevie makes me happy. I asked the lady who interviewed me
      on the radio if she wanted to see my penis and then I felt guilty about
      it, but she said she was surprised to see me fully clothed before I said
      it, but I still felt weird, just don't want to be thought of as a sexist
      pig jock asshole like the bum rap we have gotten in the past... Tonight we
      play a show and I'm gonna give all I got. We're staying in a fancy hotel
      but the shower and the phone and the air-conditioning in my room don't
      work. I'm trying to decide whether or not to shave my head.

      Here in Hamburg still. Just got back from the show which was kind of
      weird. It just wasn't really our night I guess..... We played ok, but
      there [were] some business misunderstandings with our management before we
      went on and it put a strange feeling in the air for us. It was also being
      filmed and recorded for german broadcast and I think that there was some
      self consciousness going on and our freedom which serves us so well was a
      little bit constrained. The audience was also very industry and reserved,
      not as energetic as usual. Before we went on though I saw a quote by Elvin
      Jones talking about playing with Coltrane and saying that they loved the
      music so much it never made a difference to them whether they were playing
      for fifty thousand people or three, and that hit home with me and I didn't
      really care about the crowd that much. Anyway,,,, it wasn't a stinker or
      anything, just not up to the level of cosmic love which really gets the
      spirits jumping.

      Pyrzxl is a word that was in a book that read once when I was kid and if

      eyes. I spent a lot of time working on it but never got it right. We all
      just got into Hamburg Germany today and are jet lagged and delirious. John
      said he really needed some liquids when we arrived at the airport and I
      laughed for about twenty minutes. It is weird like a motherfucker around
      here, fucking germans running all over the place. we had dinner with the
      record company people, last time we were here they gave us all watches.
      Anthony and I walked around the city and talked about how much better it
      is to do something good that never sees the light of day than to be
      another asshole following flashy trends. Tomorrow we rock a little club
      somewhere. I miss my daughter. Maybe I'll go out and take in some good
      comedy.

      People........... Here I am in Boston in yet another of an endless stream
      of hotels. We played last night at the Tweeter Center and rocked like
      animals. It is the funnest part of the set to play the new songs, and I
      can't wait until the record comes out and everybody knows the songs so we
      can play 'em all and connect with the folks. There was a band in our
      dressing room called fuzzy pink and they were talking about sucking John
      dry. They didn't do it though, The band next door to us had strippers
      doing lewd things in their dressing room but I didn't see because
      strippers make me nervous. We are flying to Germany tonight to start being
      in Europe for 2 weeks or so doing press (which I hate doing and am
      dreading) and to play shows which will invigorate my existence and make
      the world a better place. I'm gonna go now and have a stroll around Boston
      then come back here and watch the spurs blazers game then go to the
      airport.

    <p>Hello everybody,</p>
    <p>
      We played Raven's Stadium In Baltimore, Maryland tonight For 75 thousand
      motherfucking people. It always feels weird to me to play for so many
      people, it's like they stop being people and become just heads and bodies.
      I just try and focus on the music as hard as I can and support My
      bandmates. My daughter Clara was there and that always makes it a special
      show for me. The guys from Fugazi were there too and it made me a little
      nervous, they are such an incredible band, I look up to them so much. Any
      way it was a lot of fun and I'm back at the hotel and gonna try to get
      some sleep and fly to Boston tomorrow and rock there in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>love flea</p>

      p.s. We got a police escort to the show it was pretty funny. My mom was
      very impressed, I tried to act like it happened all the time.
